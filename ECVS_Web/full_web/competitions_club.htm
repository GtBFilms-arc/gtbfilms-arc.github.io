The Choice of the Clubs Competition is an annual competition between a number of amateur Moviemaking clubs. Entries are received from competing clubs and all films are circulated (as a showreel selection) round all the competitors. Each club then awards points to each film (they are not permitted to award points to their own film) and circulates the showreel to the next club in the list. Once all clubs viewed and awarded points to all the films, the points are counted and the winning film awarded the Choice of Clubs Trophy, which they retain for one year.
