In a change to our published programme, Bob Bell presented his evening on Tips and Tricks of Film-making, which had unfortunately been post-poned from last year. Bob brought along a wonderful array of devices which he had created to enable him to get tricky shots, and showed the audience how anyone can make various devices when on a budget. We also heard about some of the pitfalls of film-making and how to avoid/correct them.<br>

After the recent spate of bad weather, club members were glad to return to attend a very interesting evening presented by Dr Norman Speirs. Norman presented a selection of films produced outwith the club, to enable a frank and open discussion on the techniques used, and the good and bad points of each film - safe in the knowledge that no-one would be offended! This proved to be an excellent learning experience and another very worthwhile evening from Norman.<br>

Jim Closs presented a very interesting evening on the techniques he used to produce video from 
still images. While many film-makers use stills in their films, one must be careful to prevent the 
finished film turning into a slide-show. Jim showed the club the methods he used to capture high quality 
images, and then how to introduce movement into these images to create dynamic and interesting footage.<p>
