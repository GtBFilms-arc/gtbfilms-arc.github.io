<B>COMPETITION INSTRUCTIONS:</B><p>
On receiving the selection of films for showing, each club should allocate ten judges from their membership who will award points to the films.<p>

Try to ensure fair judging by having no discussion during the show, so that each juror makes a personal choice.<p>

Each juror awards.... <br>
3 points to his first choice <br>
2 points to his second choice <br>
1 point to his third choice<p>

Ten jurors with six points each add up to sixty points per club - please check
your total!<br>
If you do not have ten jurors the sixty points should be equally
allocated to the jurors you appoint. (i.e five jurors would each allocate
twelve points, that is 6, 4,2, thereby still ensuring sixty points are awarded).
(please remember that your jury cannot award points to your own club’s entry). 
<p>
<B>NOTES FOR THE PROJECTIONIST:</B><p>

This should be a straightforward programme. please check the videos and
boxes in and out: ensure that the videos are rewound affer they have been
viewed and before they are passed to the next club on the list. please treat
them the way you would treat your own prized productions!<p>

<b>FINALLY...</B><p>
Please post your voting slip back to ECVS with any comments as soon after your
club has viewed the videos as possible. This will help us to keep track of the
videos as they go round the circuit. ECVS will enclose an envelope for the return of
your voting slip.<p>

Thank you once again for taking part in the competition, thus keeping it alive. the clubs have enjoyed the competition for more than 30 years!<p>
