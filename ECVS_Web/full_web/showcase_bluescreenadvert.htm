"Introduction to ECVS", is a short advertisement produced by ECVS members during a hands-on film-making evening on Thursday 2nd April 2009. 
This film was made using our bluescreen room. 
<p>
Several members listed the benefits of ECVS membership and 
we used chromakey to replace the background with photos and film clips of ECVS facilities and productions.
<p>
We used 
the free <a href="http://www.xiberpix.net/SqirlzMorph.html" target="_top">Squirlz Morph</a> package to morph the 
faces of the subjects into one another.
