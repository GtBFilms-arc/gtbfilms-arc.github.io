<B>Cinema</B><br>
We are fortunate enough to have a permanent cinema in our clubrooms, it has a seating capacity of 54, 
featuring real cinema seats, rescued from a local cinema which was closing down. We have a reasonably 
large (~10 foot diagaonal) projection screen, complete with automated curtains. We are able to project both
4:3 aspect films, and 16:9 widescreen films. A surround-sound system is also installed, all of which are 
controlled from the sound-proof projection box. Our new state-of-the art projector can project films in a 
variety of formats - miniDV, DVD, VHS, while we also retain the ability to project cine film when required.

<B>Multi-Use Room</B><br>
The multi-use room was originally an editing suite, however as most members now have their own equipment at 
home, this was not being used as regularly as it had been in the past. We have therefore converted this room into 
a general purpose room, which is occassionally used for filming, planning projects, catering, and storage.

<B>The Blue Room</B></br>
The blue room was created several years ago from what used to be an additional (overflow) cinema room. The blue room 
now features an entire wall set aside for blue screen (chromakey) 
work. We also have a matching blue carpet for full-length chromakey effects. This room is equipped with 
various lighting options, to ensure the best possible lighting conditions. We also use this room for general filming 
(facing the other direction) and as it is also still equipped with a small projection screen, it has been used on 
occassion for slide show viewing.

<B>Kitchen</B><br>
Our newly refurbished kitchen is able to cater for teas and coffees each club night. We also have a cooker so are 
able to produce hot food when required. We have a large amount of 
storage space, and cater for larger groups when special events are held.

We have a large meeting room, in which members can congregate before club evenings and during tea and coffee breaks. With plenty
