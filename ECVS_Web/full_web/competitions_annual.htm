The Annual Competition is the main event for the members to compete in and is usually held at the end of January and 
beginning of February.  It is open to film and video/dvd and both are regarded equally in the 
judging and in the presentations.  There is no entry fee but an entry form should be completed 
for each film or video/dvd entered. We also hold a still photography competition, for more information on this, 
(<a href="#budgie">The Budgie Cup</a>) please see the bottom of this page (or click the link).
<p>
Many trophies are awarded in our Annual Competition  in classes such as Fiction, Documentary, Animation, Travel, 
Family, Holiday, etc., but you do not need to specify the class beforehand.  There is no 
limit to the length of the production but it is an accepted fact that long films, say 30 
minutes or more, stand much less chance of being prize-winners than the shorter films.
<p>
Three adjudicators judge the films and prepare comments on each one.  
They also decide which films are to be shown on the two nights and, most importantly, 
they decide the winners of the various trophies.  Although there are 14 trophies to be awarded, 
the judges may withhold some if they feel that there is no entry of sufficient standard 
to merit an award.

<H3>LIZARS  TROPHY</H3>
</center>
This is the top award in the Annual Competition and may be won by a film entry.  
It is our oldest cup and dates back to our first Annual Competition in 1937.  
It is solid silver, presented by the Optical and Photographic retailers, Messrs J Lizars.

<H3>50th ANNIVERSARY  TROPHY</H3>
</center>
This award is made to the film which is runner-up to the Lizars winner.  
Originally the Lizars Trophy was for a cine film entry; the 50th Anniversary Trophy was 
presented in 1986 to be awarded to the Best Video but, as both cine-film and video are 
regarded equally, this trophy is now for the Runner-Up.

The award for the best Documentary Film was given by Alan Harper, a Director of Campbell-Harper 
Films which specialised in the making of documentary films.  Alan Harper regularly appeared on 
judging panels for the E.C.S. Annual Competition.

<H3>HENDRY  TROPHY</H3>
</center>
The original designation was for the best family or holiday film'.  This still applies but 
it is more often given to a family film now.  Jim Hendry who gave the cup, was a former 
President of Edinburgh Cine Society and made successful 16mm family films.

<H3>DOUGLAS  TROPHY</H3>
</center>
An award for the best Travel Film, it was specially commissioned, cast in silver and takes 
the form of a hand holding a cine camera.  The name comes from Douglas Lornie who, at the time, 
was the owner of the Douglas Studios, a Reprographic and Photographic processing firm in the city.

<H3>THE  WAVERLEY  PLATE</H3>

This trophy was presented anonymously for the best Fiction Film.  It takes its name from 
the original title of our Society which for the first two years of its life was known as 
'The Waverley Cine Society'.

<center>
<H3>REG  CARDEN  SCISSORS</H3>
</center>
This is an unique trophy and consists of a pair of scissors mounted on a wooden base.  
As its name and design implies, it is for editing.  Now that video film entries are 
accepted the trophy may be won by a videotape or dvd, even though scissors are no longer 
used in editing videos!  Reg Carden was a most enthusiastic member when he lived in Edinburgh; 
he has now retired and lives in the New Forest.

<center>
<H3>THE  BILL WALKER  TROPHY</H3>
</center>
This trophy was presented as a Sound Award and shows a microphone mounted on a wooden base.  
It is not so much for the physical quality of the sound track but rather for the USE of 
sound and originality in the construction of the sound track.

<center>
<H3>THE  SCOTIA  QUAICH</H3>
</center>
No prizes for guessing that this is an award for a film about Scotland or on a Scottish subject.  
It is actually a real quaich and, surprisingly, it has sometimes not been awarded as there were 
no films or videos about Scotland!

<H3>THE  ELLIOT  TROPHY</H3>
</center>
Intended as an award for comedy or humour but the judges have sometimes been rather pedantic 
in the interpretation of 'Comedy' as opposed to 'Humour'.  This should really be quite 
irrelevant and, if a film is sufficiently funny or witty to make you smile or laugh, then it 
should be eligible.

<center>
<H3>THE  BROCK  TROPHY</H3>
</center>
This trophy is for the film showing the greatest imagination.  Difficult to assess 
sometimes and occasionally it has been withheld but each year we hope that there will 
be some film with sufficiently imaginative filming or ideas behind it to justify its award.

Once this trophy was for the best film made in artificial light; now it is for the best 
animation film but sadly there have not been many eligible entries in the last few years.

<center>
<H3>THE  MARWICK  SHIELD</H3>
</center>
A recent sub-committee reviewing the various awards recommended that this Trophy be awarded as 
"The Judges' Choice".  You might argue that the Lizars winner is the judges' choice of the 
best film; however, the idea behind the reasoning is that it could be awarded to, say, an 
excellent fiction film which was runner-up to the Waverley Plate winner.  There is no other 
class it could get an award in, so let it be rewarded with the Marwick Shield.

This is awarded on the first of the two nights showing of the entries in the Annual Competition.  
It gives the audience a little additional interest in the viewing of the films.

<H3>THE  FRANK  WALKER  SALVER</H3>
</center>
Originally the President's Prize, it is now named after Frank Walker, an excellent film-maker 
who was four times our President.  This trophy is awarded on the basis of the audience vote on 
the final night of the film showings.  Should there be only enough entries for a single night, 
then the Frank Walker Salver goes to the film with the highest marks and the Vice-President's 
Prize to the runner-up in this vote.

The "First Award Competition" is a sub-competition to the main Annual Competition, it is open to

This is not a movie competition at all!  It is for the best colour transparency or digital  
photograph.  Members are allowed to enter six slides which should be author identified correctly, 
The unusual title of the competition is because the trophy (a pewter tankard) was presented by the 
Budgerigar Society when E.C.S. helped them out many years ago.<p>
