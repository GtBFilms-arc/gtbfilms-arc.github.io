The Budgie Cup is ECVS's only annual competition which does not involve film-making. This competition 
is for the best still photograph. Originally there was a requirement that all photographs must be in the form 
of slide transparancies, however this has been relaxed in recent years and we now accept entries in any format - 
slide, print or digital. These are then converted to photo-CD for projection.
<p>
Each year, members are allowed to enter six photographs which should be author identified correctly, the entries are  
assessed by an independant judge, often a member of Edinburgh Photographic Society. The judge will then make comments 
on each of the projected photos on the night, before revealing the winner.
<p> 
The 2008 competition attracted a slightly smaller number of entries than recent years. The competition was held on XXth XXXX 2008 and was judged by Mr XXX XXXXXX.
