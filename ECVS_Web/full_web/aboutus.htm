<font face="Arial">The Waverley Cine Society which 
						became Edinburgh Cine Society was founded in 1936, and 
						is the oldest movie making society in Scotland. The 
						Society has occupied premises in Fettes Row, in the New 
						Town of Edinburgh since its inception. The Society met 
						in rented rooms until 1938, at which time, for £500, it 
						purchased both the ground floor and basement of no 23, 
						Fettes Row to become the only Cine club in Scotland to 
						own its own meeting rooms.</font></p>
						<p style="margin-top: 2px; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
						<p style="margin-top: 2px; margin-bottom: 0pt;">
						<font face="Arial">Escalating costs over the years 
						forced the society to sell the ground floor of the 
						building and move downstairs to its existing clubroom in 
						the basement, which the society still owns. The clubroom 
						consists of a kitchen, toilets, four main meeting rooms, 
						one of which is fitted out with cinema seats for viewing 
						video and cine film projected onto the large screen from 
						the clubs cine and video projectors. Of the three 
						remaining rooms, one is fitted out with a blue-screen 
						facility for chroma-key work, one is used as a lounge 
						and the last as a multi-purpose meeting room.&nbsp;
