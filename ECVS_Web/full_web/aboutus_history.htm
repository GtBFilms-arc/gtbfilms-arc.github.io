Established in 1936, Edinburgh Cine and Video Society has a long and illustrious history. The society has seen many 
changes over the years, both internally, and in the outside world. Luckily, as a film producing society, ECVS was 
in an ideal position to record these changes for posterity!<p>

For a video-introduction to the history of the club, you may like to watch our <a href="showcase_70thanniv.htm">70th Anniversary Film</a>.<p>

We also have a wealth of press-clippings, photographs, and other documents which may be of interest to the historian. It is our intention to 
make a selection of these available via this website over time. Currently you can view a <a href="aboutus_history_decades.htm">small selection of material from our archives</a>.
