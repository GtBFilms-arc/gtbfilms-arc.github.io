Edinburgh Cine and Video Society have held a number of competitions open to non-members over the years. Our annual
Pilgrim Trust Competition is open to all film-makers, they only stipulation being that the entries should have some 
connection with Scotland, be it a Scottish theme, filmed in Scotland, or any other connection. <p>

Another competition open to non-members was our 70th Anniversary Competition, held in 2006, where entries were welcomed 
from all amateur film-makers on any subject, with a £70 prize being awarded.<p>

</center>
<br><center>This competition is open to anyone, not just E.C.V.S. members.  It is for a film about Scotland or on a Scottish theme.  
There is a magnificent rose bowl for the winner to hold for a year but he or she also gets, as a 
permanent reminder of the success, a miniature quaich, suitably engraved.<p>

This competition is organised by E.C.V.S. each year, usually near the end of April each year.  
There is a special entry form to be completed and usually a small entry fee is to be paid.<p>

The Pilgrim Trust, that gives it's name to this award, was a charitable organisation which gave a 
charitable loan to the ECVS in the 1980s.
