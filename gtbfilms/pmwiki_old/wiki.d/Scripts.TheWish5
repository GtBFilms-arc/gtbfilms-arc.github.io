text=Scene 1 - Opening Scene.%0a%0aOpening shot with titles of a train going past someplace.%0a%0aor [Shot of Waverley station, with folk coming and going, have some titles on here, then...]%0a%0a...fade to two guys (Robert and Dave) sitting at a table on the train...%0a%0aScene 2 - The Train%0a%0a%0aWe see two blokes (Robert and Dave) sitting on the train.  Dave is reading the horoscopes section of a newspaper.  %0a%0aDave: "No, there's not much around at the moment.  I need to find something soon.  Louise is wanting to get married, but of course we can't afford it."%0aRobert: "You'll find something."%0aDave: "Yes probably, I just wish I knew what the future held.  I think she's getting impatient, feeling that our relationship is going nowhere."%0aRobert: "Well, we'd all like to know the future wouldn't we?  But you are doing the right thing by not giving up trying to make things better for you and Louise."%0aDave: "Yes, you're right. %3clooks back at the paper> Well, there's nothing available here.  It's so frustrating."%0aHe throws the paper to one side in disgust.%0aRobert: "Look, I need to go.  I'll see you later okay?".%0aDave: "Yeah, cheers mate."%0aRobert puts some money on the table and leaves the cafe, as Dave stares into space with a concerned expression on his face.  He sighs, and then gets up to leave too.%0a%0aScene 2 - A quiet village street (with a well).%0a%0aWe see Dave and Louise walking hand in hand through a small village.%0aLouise: "Any jobs in today's paper?".%0aDave: "No nothing."%0aLouise: "That's been weeks now.  We're going to run out of money at some point soon."%0aDave: "Yes, I know."%0aThey walk on a bit further and come to a well.%0aLouise: "You should throw a coin into the well and make a wish, and maybe all your dreams will come true?"%0aDave: (jokingly) "Can we afford it?".%0aLouise just gives him a stare, and maybe shakes her head a wee bit, knowing he is being daft.  Dave takes out a 2p coin and throws it in.  He closes his eyes tight (close-up shot please cameraman!) and is clearly making a wish of some sort, but he doesn't say it out loud.  Then the couple continuing walking, holding hands again, and we cut to the next scene.%0a%0aScene 3 - Bedroom.%0a%0aLouise is reading a book in bed, and we see Dave getting in beside her and lying with his eyes open staring at the ceiling.  Louise puts down her book.%0aLouise: "Don't worry about things darling.  Don't let it keep you awake."%0aDave: "I'll try not to.  Goodnight love."%0aLouise turns off the light and settles down to sleep.  We see Dave still lying there looking at the ceiling (it will have to be semi-darkness).  Eventually his eyes close, and the screen goes all blurry to show that we are about to cut to the dream sequence.%0a%0aScene 4 - A darkish wood / The dream. (This entire scene will have blurry edges to the screen, to indicate that it is a dream.  We should prolly have weird music too, and no normal sounds at all like dialogue or even the sound of stuff happening - it should be visual only.)%0a%0aWe see a woman (not Louise) walking through a wood, quite happily at first, but then she starts to look more concerned and increases her pace noticeably.  A masked man catches up with her and grabs her.  She is screaming (but we can't hear it).  There is a struggle, and we can use lots of different camera angles with close-ups of facial expressions, arms struggling, etc., deliberately chaotic (i.e. lots of quick changes with the camera all over the place).  We don't see the end of the struggle, we cut straight to the next scene.%0a%0aScene 5 - Bedroom. (no screen blurriness any more)%0a%0aDave shouts and sits bolt upright in bed, breathing hard and clearly upset.  Louise wakes up and puts on the light, and looks concerned.%0aLouise: "Are you okay?  Were you dreaming?"%0aDave: (still upset) "Errr... yes... I think... yes... oh, it was horrible... there was this woman being attacked... and... oh, I don't know."%0aLouise: "It's okay, it was just a dream".%0aDave: (calming down now) "Yes, of course... I'm okay."%0aLouise and Dave settle back down to sleep, although Dave doesn't look all that relaxed.%0a%0aScene 6 - The kitchen.%0a%0aDave and Louise are having breakfast.%0aLouise: "Did you get back to sleep okay after your bad dream?".%0aDave: "Eventually yes, but it really shook me.  It seemed so real."%0aLouise: "Well, have a nice day.  Work calls.  I'd better go."%0aDave: "Okay, bye".%0a%0aScene 7 - The high street, outside the job centre.%0a%0aDave is looking into the window of the job centre, reading an advert.  Robert walks along the street, sees him, and stops to chat.%0aRobert: "Hi Dave!".%0aDave: "Oh, hi there".%0aRobert: "Are you alright?  You look tired."%0aDave: "I'm fine, I just didn't sleep much."%0aRobert: "Come on, let's get a cup of coffee, I'm buying."%0aDave: "Alright, thanks."%0aThey walk along the street, past a news stand.  A newspaper seller shouts, "Stop press!  Woman murdered in Greenbank Woods!  Read all about it!".  Dave stops abruptly, and rushes back to the news stand, grabs a paper and starts to read.%0aNewspaper seller: "30 pence for that, mate."%0aDave: "Robert, look at this!"%0aRobert: "Oh yes, that's a horrible story.  It's unbelievable."%0aDave: "No!  I mean, yes... of course it is... it's just that I *dreamed* this last night!!".%0aRobert: "After seeing it on the news, you mean?".%0aDave: "No!  I just dreamed it out of nowhere, and it has really happened!".%0aRobert: "You must have heard about it first."%0aDave: "No, look..." %3cpoints at newspaper> "...this says she was murdered between 2 and 4 in the morning.  I wasn't listening to the news then!".%0aNewspaper seller: "Um... 30 pence, please."%0aDave (ignoring seller): "It doesn't make any sense."%0aRobert: "It's just a strange and horrible coincidence."%0aDave: "No... no, it isn't...".%0aRobert: "Come on, I'll buy you that coffee and you'll calm down."%0aDave and Robert walk away, still with the paper.%0aNewspaper seller (coming after them): "Oi!  You haven't paid for that!".%0a%0aScene 8 - The cafe.%0a%0aDave and Robert are seated as before, with coffees.  Dave looks upset.%0aRobert: "Calm down man, you're just upset because a woman died, which is perfectly understandable of course.  I'm upset about that too!  But don't get carried away about a horrible coincidence in a dream you had."%0aDave: "It wasn't like any dream I've had before, Robert.  It was so real."%0aRobert puts his hand on Dave's shoulder in a gesture of comfort.%0a%0aScene 9 - Dave and Louise's kitchen.%0a%0aWe interrupt Dave and Louise in mid conversation.%0aDave: "So you see, it was exactly what I dreamed about!".%0aLouise: "I agree it's very strange, but don't get carried away darling, just forget about it.  It's a horrible business, best forgotten anyway."%0aDave (frowning): "Hmmmm.....".%0aLouise: "Come on, it's bed time."%0aThey both leave the room.%0a%0aScene 10 - Bedroom.%0a%0aLouise is sleeping, and we see Dave lying beside her with his eyes open staring at the ceiling again (in semi-darkness).  His eyes close, and the screen goes all blurry again, leading to another dream sequence.%0a%0aScene 11 - A bathroom / Dream sequence (blurry edges to the screen / no sound except weird music).%0a%0aThere is a man having a shower (he can wear swimming trunks, as we do no want to see those bits) and there follows a sequence like in Psycho where a man with a knife (we don't see who he is) comes in and attacks, and we see the knife thrusting, and the showering person screaming and trying to fend somebody off, and the knife thrusting again (we do no see any contact of course, just like in Psycho) and then blood running down the plug hole.%0a%0aScene 12 - Bedroom. (no screen blurriness any more)%0a%0aAgain, Dave shouts and sits bolt upright in bed, breathing hard and clearly upset.  Louise wakes up and puts on the light, and looks concerned.%0aLouise: "Another bad dream?"%0aDave: "Yes!  Oh my god!".%0aLouise: "Calm down Dave, it's alright now."%0aDave: "But what if it's real?".%0aHe gets up out of bed.%0aLouise: "Where are you going?".%0aDave: "To listen to the radio, to find out what's really happening."%0aLouise: "Oh come on, don't be daft, come back to bed."%0aDave: "No.  I won't sleep until I know if it's real or not."%0aHe leaves the room.%0a%0aScene 13 - Living room.%0a%0aDave listens to the radio, but there is nothing of note.  We see the clock hands moving around (quickly) to 7:30.  Louise comes in.%0aLouise: "Anything?".%0aDave: "No, it seems to be okay this time".%0aLouise: "Of course it is.  But these nightmares aren't good for you.  I want you to go and see if the doctor can help you at all, with some pills to calm you down."%0aDave: "It's just so weird.  I never used to have nightmares.  Okay, I'll see what the doctor thinks."%0a%0aScene 14 - Doctor's surgery.%0a%0aDave is lying on the couch, with the doctor (either male or female) sitting nearby.  We join them in mid-conversation.%0aDave: "...so it's as if the first dream became real.  Thankfully the second one hasn't."%0aDoctor: "Yes, I see.  Well Mr Black, there's nothing I can do for you at this stage, based on only two bad dreams, but if they continue then we could consider a course of valium .  Come back and see me next week."%0aDave: "Valium?  Erm, okay.  What about the first dream becoming real?".%0aDoctor: "A coincidence.  My advice is to forget it.  If you let it worry you then it will only make you feel worse, and the situation becomes self-perpetuating."%0aDave: "Well, okay then, you know best I suppose.  Bye."%0aDoctor: "Goodbye".%0aDave leaves the room.  The doctor picks up the phone.%0aDoctor: "Sally, could you put me through to the police?  Thanks.  %3cwaits>  "Hello, it's Doctor Goodwin here.  Is that Inspector Collins?  %3cwaits>  It's about the body you had me look at first thing this morning.  I've just had a man in my surgery who seems to know all about it.  %3cwaits>  Yes, I know the story hasn't reached the media yet, that's why.... %3cwaits> ...yes, exactly.  %3cwaits>  Yes, Sally will be able to provide you with his details.  I'll put you through.  %3cwaits>  No problem Inspector.  Goodbye.  %3cpresses button on phone>  Hi Sally, there's an Inspector Collins on the line.  Please provide him with David Black's address and any other details he wants.  %3cwaits>  Yes, that's right.  Thanks."%0aThe doctor puts the phone down, frowns and says, "Hmmmm" in a thoughtful way.%0a%0aScene 15 - At Dave's front door.%0a%0aWe see just the door, and then hear the doorbell ring.  Dave walks into the scene and answers the door.  There is a policeman there.%0aCollins: "Mr David Edwin Black?".%0aDave: "Yes".%0aCollins: "Hello sir, my name is Inspector Collins. %3cdisplays ID badge> I'm afraid I need to ask you some questions.  May I come in?".%0aDave: "Err, yes... of course... what's this about?"%0aCollins: "It's just a few questions."%0aDave: "Okay... well, come in then, I suppose".%0aThe inspector comes in, and they move through to the living room.%0a%0aScene 16 - Living room.%0a%0aThey sit down.%0aCollins: "Mr Black, where were you between 3 and 4am last night?"%0aDave: "I was here, asleep.  Well, I didn't sleep very well actually, and I got up for a while."%0aCollins: "But you stayed in the house?"%0aDave: "Yes."%0aCollins: "Is there anybody who could verify that?"%0aDave: "Yes, my girlfriend Louise."%0aCollins: "And her full name is?"%0aDave: "Louise McLean.  She's at work at the moment."%0aCollins: "I see.  And she lives here with you?"%0aDave: "Yes."%0aCollins: "Mr Black, do you know a man named Geoffrey Jones?"%0aDave: "No, I don't think so."%0aCollins: "How about the man in this picture?  Do you recognise him?"%0aThe inspector hands Dave a photograph.  Dave's eyes widen when he looks at it, and he takes a sharp intake of breath.%0aDave: "Errr...."%0aCollins: "Clearly you do recognise the gentleman, sir.  Would you care to explain how?"%0aDave: "I don't know him as such, but... well... this sounds crazy, but I dreamed about him last night.  I saw his face as clearly as I see this picture now.  Is this Geoffrey Jones?"%0aCollins: "It is.  And you say you *dreamed* him?"%0aDave: "Yes.  Oh, it was horrible.  He was being attacked in the shower.  Please tell me he hasn't *really* been attacked."%0aCollins: "I'm afraid he has.  He was attacked and killed last night in his home."%0aDave: "Oh no!  Oh my god!"%0aCollins: "We haven't found the murder weapon yet.  But perhaps you have it here in your house?"%0aDave: "Surely you're not accusing me?!  Well, of course I have a kitchen knife for chopping vegetables, but so has everyone!"%0aCollins: "I didn't say that the murder weapon was a knife.  I think you'd better accompany me to the station, Mr Black."%0aDave: "Oh no, look, it's not what you're thinking!"%0aCollins: "Are you resisting arrest, sir?"%0aDave: "No... no... of course not... it's just..."%0aCollins: "Let's discuss it at the station, Mr Black."%0aInspector Collins leads Dave out of the room.%0a%0aScene 17 - A police cell.%0a%0a%0aThe remaining plot%0a%0aDave is put in a cell.  Overnight he dreams about a bank robbery.  This actually happens the next day, but because he is in a cell the whole time, the police know it isn't him doing it.  He tells the inspector about his dream, and the inspector sends a man over to the bank (a specific one) to have a look.  This man finds the robbery in progress.  It becomes clear that Dave is dreaming about things before they happen.  The police make a deal with Dave, that if he helps them with predictive crime fighting, they won't press charges about the Geoffrey Jones murder.  Dave says that was nothing to do with him anyway.  The police say that they can still make life very difficult for him if he won't help them, so he agrees.  He is therefore released.  We see him later, looking terrible, walking along with Louise.  They are discussing how successful the crime fighting now is, thanks to his abilities.  But he is a tormented soul, unable to sleep properly, and is not at all happy about the situation.  They come across the same well as before, and see another couple saying "Make a wish and your dreams will come true", and throwing in a coin.  And then there is a moment of realisation on Dave's face.  Then we see this other guy sleeping in his bed that night, very restlessly, and then waking up suddenly.  The screen goes black and we hear his wife/partner say, "Are you okay?  Did you have a bad dream?".  The end.%0a%0a%0a%0aCast:%0a1. Dave%0a2. Robert%0a3. Louise%0a4. Woman in the woods%0a5.

I've just had a man in my surgery who seems to know all about it.  %3cwaits>  Yes, I know the story hasn't reached the media yet, that's why.... %3cwaits> ...yes, exactly.  %3cwaits>  Yes, Sally will be able to provide you with his details.  I'll put you through.  %3cwaits>  No problem Inspector.  Goodbye.  %3cpresses button on phone>  Hi Sally, there's an Inspector Collins on the line.  Please provide him with David Black's address and any other details he wants.  %3cwaits>  Yes, that's right.  Thanks."%0a%3c The doctor puts the phone down, frowns and says, "Hmmmm" in a thoughtful way.%0a%3c %0a%3c Scene 15 - At Dave's front door.%0a%3c %0a%3c We see just the door, and then hear the doorbell ring.  Dave walks into the scene and answers the door.  There is a policeman there.%0a%3c Collins: "Mr David Edwin Black?".%0a%3c Dave: "Yes".%0a%3c Collins: "Hello sir, my name is Inspector Collins. %3cdisplays ID badge> I'm afraid I need to ask you some questions.  May I come in?".%0a%3c Dave: "Err, yes... of course... what's this about?"%0a%3c Collins: "It's just a few questions."%0a%3c Dave: "Okay... well, come in then, I suppose".%0a%3c The inspector comes in, and they move through to the living room.%0a%3c %0a%3c Scene 16 - Living room.%0a%3c %0a%3c They sit down.%0a%3c Collins: "Mr Black, where were you between 3 and 4am last night?"%0a%3c Dave: "I was here, asleep.  Well, I didn't sleep very well actually, and I got up for a while."%0a%3c Collins: "But you stayed in the house?"%0a%3c Dave: "Yes."%0a%3c Collins: "Is there anybody who could verify that?"%0a%3c Dave: "Yes, my girlfriend Louise."%0a%3c Collins: "And her full name is?"%0a%3c Dave: "Louise McLean.  She's at work at the moment."%0a%3c Collins: "I see.  And she lives here with you?"%0a%3c Dave: "Yes."%0a%3c Collins: "Mr Black, do you know a man named Geoffrey Jones?"%0a%3c Dave: "No, I don't think so."%0a%3c Collins: "How about the man in this picture?  Do you recognise him?"%0a%3c The inspector hands Dave a photograph.  Dave's eyes widen when he looks at it, and he takes a sharp intake of breath.%0a%3c Dave: "Errr...."%0a%3c Collins: "Clearly you do recognise the gentleman, sir.  Would you care to explain how?"%0a%3c Dave: "I don't know him as such, but... well... this sounds crazy, but I dreamed about him last night.  I saw his face as clearly as I see this picture now.  Is this Geoffrey Jones?"%0a%3c Collins: "It is.  And you say you *dreamed* him?"%0a%3c Dave: "Yes.  Oh, it was horrible.  He was being attacked in the shower.  Please tell me he hasn't *really* been attacked."%0a%3c Collins: "I'm afraid he has.  He was attacked and killed last night in his home."%0a%3c Dave: "Oh no!  Oh my god!"%0a%3c Collins: "We haven't found the murder weapon yet.  But perhaps you have it here in your house?"%0a%3c Dave: "Surely you're not accusing me?!  Well, of course I have a kitchen knife for chopping vegetables, but so has everyone!"%0a%3c Collins: "I didn't say that the murder weapon was a knife.  I think you'd better accompany me to the station, Mr Black."%0a%3c Dave: "Oh no, look, it's not what you're thinking!"%0a%3c Collins: "Are you resisting arrest, sir?"%0a%3c Dave: "No... no... of course not... it's just..."%0a%3c Collins: "Let's discuss it at the station, Mr Black."%0a%3c Inspector Collins leads Dave out of the room.%0a%3c %0a%3c Scene 17 - A police cell.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The remaining plot%0a%3c %0a%3c Dave is put in a cell.  Overnight he dreams about a bank robbery.  This actually happens the next day, but because he is in a cell the whole time, the police know it isn't him doing it.  He tells the inspector about his dream, and the inspector sends a man over to the bank (a specific one) to have a look.  This man finds the robbery in progress.  It becomes clear that Dave is dreaming about things before they happen.  The police make a deal with Dave, that if he helps them with predictive crime fighting, they won't press charges about the Geoffrey Jones murder.  Dave says that was nothing to do with him anyway.  The police say that they can still make life very difficult for him if he won't help them, so he agrees.  He is therefore released.  We see him later, looking terrible, walking along with Louise.  They are discussing how successful the crime fighting now is, thanks to his abilities.  But he is a tormented soul, unable to sleep properly, and is not at all happy about the situation.  They come across the same well as before, and see another couple saying "Make a wish and your dreams will come true", and throwing in a coin.  And then there is a moment of realisation on Dave's face.  Then we see this other guy sleeping in his bed that night, very restlessly, and then waking up suddenly.  The screen goes black and we hear his wife/partner say, "Are you okay?  Did you have a bad dream?".  The end.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Cast:%0a%3c 1. Dave%0a%3c 2. Robert%0a%3c 3. Louise%0a%3c 4.
