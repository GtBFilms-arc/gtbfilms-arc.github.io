His hood is up, so you do not see his face.%0a%0aHe recieves a message, and a wee blue crackly hologram guy appears in front of him, it is some boy in a semi-military uniform:%0a%0aHoloDude: The target has been destroyed Sir, but they appear to have jettissoned the plans before we were able to intercept them.%0aSith: Have the plans been recovered commander?%0aHoloDude: Not yet my Lord, I am arranging a recovery party and we expect....%0a%0aSith puts up his finga and the Holodude dries up and starts cluthcing his neck and choking and that.%0a%0aSith: You have failed me for the last time, we must remain inconspicuous, I will recover the plans myself.%0a%0aWee holodude collapses over just as the blue hologram disappears.%0a%0aThe Sith boy turns away and his cloak sweeps across the camera like a wipe and wipes to...%0a%0a%0aSCENE 5 Dereks House%0a--------------------%0a%0a...the camera sweeps from behind a chair to...%0a%0aTrevor and Derek are having a drink, and Derek tells Trevor that he found this really nice coin/ring whatever in the woods near his house. He shows him it. Trevor is impressed, and wants something like this too.%0a%0aDerek:  "I was out with the metal detector yesterday evening...."%0a%0aTrevor: "That old thing, I don't know why you waste your time with that, you never find anything of interest.."%0a%0aDerek: "Oh yeah? Well what about THIS then?" %0a%0aDerek holds out this coin/item%0a%0aTrevor is impressed.%0a%0aTrevor "Wow! That has got to be worth a few quid, where did you find it?"%0a%0aDerek "In the old spooky wood on the edge of town?"%0a%0aTrevor "The old spooky wood that no-one ventures into any more?"%0a%0aDerek "Yes"%0a%0aBoth look simultaneously at the camera, both with a sort of one eyebrow raised expression, the camera has the wide angle lense fitted, it zooms in slowly and the two  maintain their expressions.%0a%0aCut to normal view again.%0a%0aTrevor "Cool, let's go and see if we can find anything else!"%0a%0aDerek "I can't. I've got to take the car to get fixed, but you can borrow my metal detector if you like..."%0a%0aTrevor "Thanks Derek, I'll give you a share if I find anything"%0a%0a> At some point early in the film, when Joe and Fred are%0a> talking, we can have a reference to "Are you going to fencing %0a> class on Thursday?" or something like that, to explain why %0a> Joe isn't totally hopeless with a lightsabre.  After all, how %0a> would an inexperienced person beat a Sith Lord?  Or we could %0a> just ignore this aspect, I suppose.%0a%0a%0aSCENE 6 The woods%0a----------------- %0a%0aTrevor goes to the place where Derek found the coin. He is using his metal detector.%0a %0aInitially he finds something crap, maybe a nail, but then the metal detector goes nuts. %0a%0aHe digs and finds a metal box.%0a%0aHe opens the box, and inside is a computer disk marked "Operation Armageddon - Top Secret" and a light sabre.%0a%0aHe doesn't know what they are. %0a%0aHe tries to switch on the lightsabre, but it doesn't appear to work, he looks at the disk for a second.%0a%0aTrevor is of course impressed with this, Then we see a dark figure come out of the shadows. %0aSomebody has been watching Trevor, and he does not look very pleased! %0a%0aTrevor hears something, says the classic star wars line:%0a%0aTrevor: "I have a bad feeling about this" %0a%0a...and runs back to his car with the items. %0a%0aThe dark figure arrives at the hole in the ground, he looks int he discarded metal box, and sees that it is now empty. He makes a frustrated fist movement, then looks around to see if he can see the perpetrator.%0a%0aThe dark figure looks through special space-style binoculars, and we can have like it all green and zoom in, and computer writing down the side, and then it freezes on the number plate, and computer writing doon the bottom goes IDENTIFICATION N133 GLO...LOGGED.%0a%0aSort of like Terminator eyeballs work, then you see a medium shot of him lowering his space 'nocliars, so you know it was his 'nocliars doing that, not his eyes.%0a%0aYou can only really see his mouth under his hood, and as he lowers the 'nocliars, he smiles.%0a%0aSCENE 7 Unknown room somewhere%0a------------------------------%0a%0aPossible computer generated back ground of inside a futuristic looking space ship, this this guy done on a blue screen to put him in the location.%0a%0aWe see the dark figure using a computer to search a database of registration numbers and addresses. He finds Trevor's number, and therefore discovers his address.%0a%0aWe can do a really tacky movie-style computer there, where is still like a DOS program and it does stuff that real computers do no do, but they always do in fillums, like spooling loads of nonsense up the screen while flashing SEARCHING ... in the middle, and that.%0a%0aSCENE 8 Outside Trevor's house (later)%0a--------------------------------------%0a%0aWe have a scene of the ship landing in some street, and the dark figure leaving it, and he turns back with his wee door central locking bleeper, and it makes the spaceship go invisible, then he watches Trevor leave his house, and goes back to his ship to follow him.%0a%0a%0a%0aSCENE 9 Forth Road Bridge%0a-------------------------%0a(Could be done with footage shot later)%0a%0aTrevor is still being followed by the dark figure as he crosses the bridge.%0a%0aCool Footage of the car going over the bridge, put the spaceship in later using a computer rendered spaceship bluescreened onto the original footage.%0a%0a%0aSCENE 10 Road in Fife%0a---------------------%0a%0aThe dark figure is getting shoots his spaceship laser guns, forcing Trevor off the road! %0a%0aWith some pyro special effects added onto the footage later, at the side of the road as the car goes past. %0a%0aThen you see the car stop, someplace right, and in the background, the spaceship is landing. %0a%0aCut to the boy out the spaceship noo, so we do not have to worry aboot HOW he gets oot a ship that is not really there. %0a%0aHe probably does that invisible ship thing again here.%0a %0aThe dark figure pulls Trevor from the car and says threateningly, %0a%0aDarth "You have something of mine!". %0a%0a%0aDarth removes his hood and we see his face for the first time. Trevor is terrified and runs away up a hill.%0a%0aWe get a shot of the advancing Darth guy, and he has draw his light sabre and is holding it down by his side, he switches it on and the beam lights up as he advances on Trevor!%0a%0a%0aSCENE 11 On the hill%0a--------------------%0a%0aTrevor falls over, and the dark figure catches up with him. He tries to cut him in half with the light sabre. Trevor rolls over to dodge this.%0a%0aIn desperation pulls his light sabre out and fumbles with it, trying to switch it on. He looks at it in panic, and we see a closeup of the safety catch button, he slides it off and tries to switches it on again.%0a%0aWhile this is happening the Darth guy is doing some rather pointless showing off with his lightsabre swinging it around etc. Trevors lightsabre springs to life as he scambles to his feet.%0a%0aA battle takes place, with the Forth bridges in the background. Trevor is quite unsure of himself, not being used to fighting, and initially does badly. %0a%0aAnd gets his hand/arm cut off ! (Maybe)%0a%0aBut of course in the end he wins (we will have to think up some interesting or even amusing things to happen during the fight).%0a%0aWhen the dark figure is killed he vanishes to nothing like Obi Wan did (just clothing left).%0a%0aHis boots are smoking!%0a %0aTrevor picks up the other light sabre. He now has two of them! %0a%0aSCENE 12 Ending sequence%0a------------------------%0a%0aWe see Trevor and Derek talking, it fades slowly into focus.%0a%0aTrevor: "...and that's exactly how it happened..."%0aDerek (incredulously): "and there was nothing left at all?"%0aTrevor: "Well only these..."%0a%0aTrevor takes out the two lightsabres and shows them to Derek.%0a%0aDerek takes one, he turns it on and waves it about a wee bit, while he is doing it, Trevor switches his on as well.%0a%0aDerek: "Fantastic!"%0a%0aTrevor: " Yup, my wish has come true, real life is going to be a LOT more like Star Wars from now on..."%0a%0aBoth laugh and the shot pulls out to show they are next to their car, which is facing away from them, and they are at the back of it, they both go to get in either side of the car, lightsabres still on. %0a%0aThen they remember, switch OFF the light sabres, and get into the car properly and drive away. %0a%0aAs the car leaves we see they have a new personalised number plate: JED1.%0a%0aEND MUSIC AND CREDITS.%0a%0aIdeas:%0aShould the Sith boy be wearing a rubber alien mask thing, or do we make him up?
