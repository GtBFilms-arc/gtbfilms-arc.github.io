The script-writing process had a bit of a set-back when he left his previous job and therefore had less free time to waste, but recently he wrote almost all of the script for [[Films/PIF | Identify Theft]] in less than an hour. The other major script contributor is [[Actors/BrownAlan | Alan Brown]]. Like all GtB Films stars, Andrew's acting abilities are not very good, but he does enjoy showing the finished products to friends and family.
