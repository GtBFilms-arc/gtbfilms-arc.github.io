There was a thing on Virgin Radio this morning about James Bond, which is currently being filmed. They were getting folk to text them things that you never see James Bond doing. It was quite funny, like you never see him coming out of the gents with a small circle of damp on his trousers, or struggling to get served in a bar and then getting the wrong drink (stirred instead of shaken), or not really knowing what to do next, or being all nervous while his girlfriend takes a pregnancy test, or phoning his mum from a foreign country to let her know that he's okay and he got there safely. So I thought, maybe there SHOULD be a James Bond film where the hero (or anti-hero) does things like these, and maybe WE SHOULD MAKE IT! He would still have a bad guy to catch of course. What else do you never see James Bond doing???%0a%0a%0aOkay, maybe that idea has already been done (a bit) by Austin Powers.%0a%0aBtw, does anybody else use this scratchpad?%0a%0a----%0aBy GtB:%0a%0aYES! I do! But I have been busy updating the main page!%0a%0aHmmm, I like the idea of a bit of a spongol James Bond - [[Scripts/JBond | Joseph Bond]] perhaps? He would have to look very sophisticated and all that, but act in a non suave and sophisticated manner - maybe a bit too madcap though, I dunno. Presumably he could beat the villain more through luck than good judgement, or alternatively he has a sidekick who is effective - in the grand tradition of Hong Kong Phooey, Dangermouse etc. Maybe we have done that already with Norris and Melvin. See what other lards think.%0a%0aA script page has been created for this idea [[Scripts/JBond | here.]] %0a----%0a[[#ManagementSpeak]]%0aBy Baldas:%0a%0aThis isn't a plot idea, this is just a wee eccentricity that a character in a film could have. Something happened at my work yesterday that I found amusing and I thought we could use. The boss likes his buzzwords and management speak (as do all bosses) but he got a bit mixed up at one point and said "Let's make sure we're all p*ssing up the same flag pole". After that there was an amused pause, and he said, "Erm, that's a different version, but you know what I mean". Well, OUR character could do this sort of thing, but without realising his mistakes, in a Del Boy kind of fashion.%0a%0aExamples (in addition to the above one, which I think is great):%0a%0a1. "We need to think outside the box" AND "Don't reinvent the wheel" --> becomes --> "We need to think outside the wheel" OR "Don't re-invent the box".%0a%0a2. "You can't make an omelette without breaking eggs" AND "Do some blue-sky thinking" --> becomes --> "You can't make an omelette without some blue sky thinking".%0a%0aThere must be loads of possibilities. A quick Google for "management speak" helped me create these. The best bit of all is that it makes fun of management. It could be Norris in [[Scripts/WhatAMess2 | Attic Of The Clones]] that says these things, i.e. he is a bit of a sponjol so he is ideal.%0a%0a----%0a%0aBy GtB:%0a%0aYou could open up a whole Pandora's Box of Worms there Baldas.%0a%0aI like it though, once it was made, no-one could complain,as it would all be spilt milk under the bridge anyway.%0a%0a----%0a%0aBy Baldas:%0a%0aActually no, it's not Norris that uses all the management speak, it's KELVIN. Norris didn't talk like that in the first movie, so why would he now? Kelvin isn't Norris's new helper, he is a MOTIVATION COUNCELLOR brought in by Edwina before she left (because the flat is a mess and Norris is a lazy git). So Kelvin (maybe he is no called Kelvin, but Julian or something) talks all rubbish like that, and Norris doesn't even like him, so they are at odds a bit which should make it more interesting. But of course when they start getting attacked by clones they fight them together, so effectively he IS Norris's new helper, it just doesn't start off that way.%0a%0a----%0a%0aBy Baldas:%0a%0aI like your management-speak, GtB. Here are my favourites so far:%0a%0aLet's make sure we're all peeing up the same flag pole%0a%0aIt's all spilt milk under the bridge%0a%0aYou could open up a whole Pandora's Box of Worms%0a%0aThere's no "I" in "Pro-Active"%0a%0aGo for the low-hanging show-stoppers%0a%0aMake sure you get all your game plans in a row%0a%0aIt's a win-win box-ticker%0a%0aYou'll dig a hole for yourself and find it going pear-shaped%0a%0aWe'll need to jump through the big picture here%0a%0aLet's float that issue on the fast track%0a%0aThink outside the wheel%0a%0aWe could have Kelvin coming out with these to try to motivate Norris, and Norris looking more and more confused.%0a%0a----%0aBy GtB:%0a%0aThere's no I in 'team' Baldas, but there is an I in Pie, Meat Pie. And 'meat' is an anagram of Team.%0a%0aSo...I hope that bearing that in mind, we can regain traction in a vertical market.%0a%0a----%0a[[#HolidayProgramme]]%0aBy Baldas:%0a%0aA different idea this time. We do a fake holiday programme, presented like all these travel shows where they tell you places to stay and things to do, but we do it about somewhere really awful and try to make out that it is really good. Probably not a real named town (although we COULD go to Cumbernauld and just film it) but I think it would be better if we invented a place name such as Bridge Of Merde or Merdehampton (think French) and used various footage of different places and pretended it was Merdehampton. Or if we want to show the town sign we could make it Skinflats (a real place near Grangemouth which sounds awful, and is).%0a%0aAll done totally straight, as if it was good, but presenting really crap things to see like taking them on a drive around town and all you see is loads of roundabouts (easily filmed in Livingston, and should be played back at ultra high speed as we whizz around them) or taking them to "the beach" but actually filming that at Grangemouth mudflats (with loads of cooling towers and industry in the background as our presenter trudges through the mud). And for places to stay, I'm sure we can find some really dreadful looking places in or around Edinburgh, then pretend we are inside it and film a room in Magnox's upstairs flat with a camp bed in it. But ALWAYS saying how great it is.%0a%0aIt wouldn't need many actors, but it would need careful selection of the various locations and a bit of travelling around to film them. And it might be hard to play it totally straight and not laugh.%0a%0a----%0aBy Gonad:%0a%0aI like the [[Scripts/Holiday | shit holiday]] idea Baldas, it is a good idea, and would be pretty funny, but needs to be delivered totally deadpan. I think it is a wee bit similar to our deadpan 'Tommorrow's World' idea, where it is like a spoof of a real kind of programme.%0a%0aI have created a new script creation page for this film idea [[Scripts/Holiday | here.]] %0a%0aHowever, please see the [[Main/News | Latest News]] page for another idea for a spoof with a pretty short timescale on it!%0a%0aOh aye, and I am thinking of changing this page a bit, to have proper discussion threads and that because it has become a bit unwieldy already!%0a%0a----%0a[[#AnotherPIF]]%0aBy Baldas:%0a%0aAfter the results of the BBC Public Information Film were announced, it became clear that we could have been a lot more madcap without it counting against us. Well, we could make another PIF! It doesn't have to be a full PIF like the last one, it could be a wee snippet that a character in a bigger film sees on the telly and switches it off (e.g. Norris in What A Mess 2). And it can be as daft as we like. Here's a suggestion: DON'T DRINK LAGER IN THE SHOWER.%0a%0a----%0aBy Gonad:%0a%0aIt is an interesting suggestion, what could possible go wrong, drinking lager in the shower? Although, I am not sure that it is worth making too many more 1 minute films, unless they are for a specific competition, or like you say, contained within a larger film. This is because it took us a good few hours to do 'Identity Theft', and we got a very short film out of it, compare with our longer films, which took longer to film, but not THAT much longer. %0a%0aFrom the other competition entries, 'Don't drive backwards down the motorway', "Stop, Look, Zombie!" and "Never look at an electricity pylon through binoculars" were the best, doing something like that could be fun, but needs to be suitably bizarre - never eat pickled onions while attempting to drive round a roundabout, or something like that.%0a%0aMy only concern is the useability of what we produce, plus the fact there are no deadlines, which GtBFilms appears to need. Maybe we would be better looking for competitions and that and attempting to produce something specifically for them.%0a%0aThere lists of various film festivals and that on the IAC website:%0a%0ahttp://www.fvi.org.uk/index.html%0a%0aOr here's a thing to create a wee advert video for the excellent free web browser firefox:%0a%0ahttp://www.spreadfirefox.com/%0a%0aHmmm, we have only got 15 days left to make a film for that one!%0a%0aThere are some links to film making competitions at:%0a%0ahttp://www.screensouth.org/pages/news/news_headlines.html%0a%0aTo stick to a Scotland competition, we could do something (I don't think there is any restriction on title/subject/type of film) for next years Scottish Association of Moviemakers competition - from this web site, I see that at least a couple of films there are by members of ECVS, and almost all the films are documentaries:%0a%0ahttp://www.fvi.org.uk/regions/Sam_2005.html%0a%0aI think making stuff specifically for competitions is more likely to get us moving!%0a%0a----%0a%0a

The boss likes his buzzwords and management speak (as do all bosses) but he got a bit mixed up at one point and said "Let's make sure we're all p*ssing up the same flag pole". After that there was an amused pause, and he said, "Erm, that's a different version, but you know what I mean". Well, OUR character could do this sort of thing, but without realising his mistakes, in a Del Boy kind of fashion.%0a%3c %0a%3c Examples (in addition to the above one, which I think is great):%0a%3c %0a%3c 1. "We need to think outside the box" AND "Don't reinvent the wheel" --> becomes --> "We need to think outside the wheel".%0a%3c %0a%3c 2. "You can't make an omelette without breaking eggs" AND "Do some blue-sky thinking" --> becomes --> "You can't make an omelette without some blue sky thinking".%0a%3c %0a%3c There must be loads of possibilities. A quick Google for "management speak" helped me create these. The best bit of all is that it makes fun of management. It could be Norris in Attic Of The Clones that says these things, i.e. he is a bit of a sponjol so he is ideal.%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a

But I have been busy updating the main page!%0a%3c %0a%3c Hmmm, I like the idea of a bit of a spongol James Bond - Joseph Bond perhaps? He would have to look very sophisticated and all that, but act in a non suave and sophisticated manner - maybe a bit too madcap though, I dunno. Presumably he could beat the villain more through luck than good judgement, or alternatively he has a sidekick who is effective - in the grand tradition of Hong Kong Phooey, Dangermouse etc. Maybe we have done that already with Norris and Melvin. See what other lards think.%0a%3c %0a

diff:1139213214:1139174756:=3,4d2%0a%3c %0a%3c A different idea. There was a thing on Virgin Radio this morning about James Bond, which is currently being filmed. They were getting folk to text them things that you never see James Bond doing. It was quite funny, like you never see him coming out of the gents with a small circle of damp on his trousers, or struggling to get served in a bar and then getting the wrong drink (stirred instead of shaken), or not really knowing what to do next, or being all nervous while his girlfriend takes a pregnancy test, or phoning his mum from a foreign country to let her know that he's okay and he got there safely. So I thought, maybe there SHOULD be a James Bond film where the hero (or anti-hero) does things like these, and maybe WE SHOULD MAKE IT! He would still have a bad guy to catch of course. What else do you never see James Bond doing???%0a
