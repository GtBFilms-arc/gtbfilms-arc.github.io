text=(:title Screen Tests:)%0a%0a|| border=0 width=80%25 align=center%0a|| From time to time, in between making films, we experiment with different techniques and ideas, to see what they will look like on-screen. Quite often new effects are used in small clips, to find out if they are possible, and to identify any pitfalls, before committing to using them in a large-scale production. ||%0a|| We have here a collection of such screen tests, which may or may not have made it into a real film! ||%0a|| ''Please note: All films are in Windows Media Player format (.wmv), you will need Windows MediaPlayer or a similarly capable mediaplayer in order to view them'' ||%0a%0a%0a|| border=1 width=90%25 align=center%0a|| [++What a Mess 2 Tests++] ||||%0a|| [[Films/WhatAMess2 | 'What a Mess 2']] is a proposed future production from GtBFilms, we created a teaser-trailer in order to test out some of the techniques we intend to use in this film, and promote interest in its production. ||||%0a|| '''What a Mess 2 - AHA Test''' [[%3c%3c]] A very short test sequence of a 1980's music-video style effect! || [[http://www.gonadovision.homeip.net/video/tests/aha_test.wmv | aha_test.wmv]] (1.2MB) ||%0a|| '''What a Mess 2 - Trailer''' (Version 0.3) [[%3c%3c]] Version 0.3 of the teaser trailer, incorporating scenes from the previous film, some teaser scenes from the new film. || [[http://www.gonadovision.homeip.net/video/tests/wam2_trailer.wmv | wam2_trailer.wmv]] (6.8MB) ||%0a%0a\\\%0a%0a|| border=1 width=90%25 align=center%0a|| [++Animation Tests++] ||||%0a|| We have been doing some experimentation with stop-motion animation. ||||%0a|| '''Test Film 2 - Blue Alien Test 1'''[[%3c%3c]]A 12 second short test film, using stop-motion animation, and a clay model.
