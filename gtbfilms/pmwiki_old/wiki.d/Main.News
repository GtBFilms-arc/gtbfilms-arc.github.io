Filming has been completed for our 60 second Public Information Film - [[Films/PIF | "Identity Theft"]] !\\\%0a%0a----%0a%25red%2516th February 2006\\%0a%25%25As part of their current review of Public Information Films (PIFs) of bygone years, the BBC have requested readers of their news website create and send in their own Public Information Films, we have some ideas for [[Scripts/PIFs | GtBFilms PIFs here]], and here is the original BBC article:\\\%0a%0ahttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4690154.stm%0a%0aIt's easy to poke fun at such efforts [PIFs from the past], but could you do better yourself? Here's your chance to try. The Magazine is inviting readers to make your own 60-second films. %0a%0aYour brief is to celebrate the art of the public information film. This means you can make a film which warns of modern danger in a contemporary style, or you can produce one in the style of films of old. It's up to you. %0a%0aYou've got until the end of the month [February] to make the film and get it to us. Instructions for sending them to us are at the bottom of the page. %0a%0aFor those of you looking for tips on how to make your film work, BBC Video Nation editor Rosemary Richards says the key thing to consider is what the audience would like to see. %0a%0aMs Richards says it's always best to get out to different locations and take lots of pictures so you can illustrate your film well - but don't overdo it. %0a%0a"Keep it simple," she says. "For example, you might want to use actors but perhaps your friends and family are not great actors. It might be best to just speak straight into the camera yourself. "You should also make sure you don't film your subjects next to windows and that you use the microphone(s) appropriately. And while hand-held camera can be used to good effect, it's usually best to make sure you have a good supply of steady shots. %0a%0a"However great your creative idea is, the film can't be used unless we can see and hear what's on it," she says. %0a%0aAlso, if you want to get your film on the web or on TV, you must make sure all the work - including the music - is your own or copyright cleared. %0a%0aSo keep it simple, make sure the images and sounds are clear and, of course, get a good story. %0a%0aInstructions for sending films %0a%0aFilms should be 60 seconds maximum. Please submit your films to us via e-mail or by post. %0a%0aE-mail attachments should be sent to the.magazine@bbc.co.uk, subject line STOP LOOK LISTEN COMPETITION. Attachments should be no bigger than 10Mb - you may be able to compress the file by zipping it. %0a%0aIf your film is above 10Mb, you can either upload it to your own personal webspace or free online storage sites (such as www.ourmedia.org) and send us an e-mail telling us its address. %0a%0aAlternatively you could use free online file transfer services - see this Creative Guy blog posting for a list of 50 such services). Again, please address these to the.magazine@bbc.co.uk, subject line STOP LOOK LISTEN COMPETITION. %0a%0aIf you want to post the file to us, please burn them on to a DVD or put them on MiniDV, and send them to: %0a%0aThe Magazine,%0aBBC News Interactive,%0aRoom 7540,%0aTelevision Centre,%0aLondon,%0aW12 7RJ%0a%0a----%0a(:html:)%0a%3ccenter>%0a%3cscript type="text/javascript">%3c!--%0agoogle_ad_client = "pub-5767714101223561";%0agoogle_ad_width = 728;%0agoogle_ad_height = 90;%0agoogle_ad_format = "728x90_as";%0agoogle_ad_type = "text_image";%0a//2007-09-12: GtBFilms%0agoogle_ad_channel = "8003625449";%0agoogle_ui_features = "rc:10";%0a//-->%0a%3c/script>%0a%3cscript type="text/javascript"%0a  src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js">%0a%3c/script>%0a%3c/center>%0a(:htmlend:)

Here's your chance to try. The Magazine is inviting readers to make your own 60-second films. %0a%3c %0a%3c Your brief is to celebrate the art of the public information film. This means you can make a film which warns of modern danger in a contemporary style, or you can produce one in the style of films of old. It's up to you. %0a%3c %0a%3c You've got until the end of the month [February] to make the film and get it to us. Instructions for sending them to us are at the bottom of the page. %0a%3c %0a%3c For those of you looking for tips on how to make your film work, BBC Video Nation editor Rosemary Richards says the key thing to consider is what the audience would like to see. %0a%3c %0a%3c Ms Richards says it's always best to get out to different locations and take lots of pictures so you can illustrate your film well - but don't overdo it. %0a%3c %0a%3c "Keep it simple," she says. "For example, you might want to use actors but perhaps your friends and family are not great actors. It might be best to just speak straight into the camera yourself. "You should also make sure you don't film your subjects next to windows and that you use the microphone(s) appropriately. And while hand-held camera can be used to good effect, it's usually best to make sure you have a good supply of steady shots. %0a%3c %0a%3c "However great your creative idea is, the film can't be used unless we can see and hear what's on it," she says. %0a%3c %0a%3c Also, if you want to get your film on the web or on TV, you must make sure all the work - including the music - is your own or copyright cleared. %0a%3c %0a%3c So keep it simple, make sure the images and sounds are clear and, of course, get a good story. %0a%3c %0a%3c Instructions for sending films %0a%3c %0a%3c Films should be 60 seconds maximum. Please submit your films to us via e-mail or by post. %0a%3c %0a%3c E-mail attachments should be sent to the.magazine@bbc.co.uk, subject line STOP LOOK LISTEN COMPETITION. Attachments should be no bigger than 10Mb - you may be able to compress the file by zipping it. %0a%3c %0a%3c If your film is above 10Mb, you can either upload it to your own personal webspace or free online storage sites (such as www.ourmedia.org) and send us an e-mail telling us its address. %0a%3c %0a%3c Alternatively you could use free online file transfer services - see this Creative Guy blog posting for a list of 50 such services). Again, please address these to the.magazine@bbc.co.uk, subject line STOP LOOK LISTEN COMPETITION. %0a%3c %0a%3c If you want to post the file to us, please burn them on to a DVD or put them on MiniDV, and send them to: %0a%3c %0a%3c The Magazine%0a%3c BBC News Interactive%0a%3c Room 7540%0a%3c Television Centre%0a%3c London%0a%3c W12 7RJ %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a
