Leroy TV begins...%0a%0a!!!Scene 2 - Leroy TV%0a%0aCouple of humorous stories e.g:%0a%0a-------------------------------------%0aThousands Lose Jobs As Glasgow Unemployment Offices Close%0a%0aIn another devastating blow to Glasgow's already fragile economy, the Unemployment Agency of the city of Glasgow today permanently shuttered nine of it's branch offices, leaving more than 8,500 unemployment employees unemployed.%0a%0aAnnouncing the closings at a press conference, Glasgow council spokesperson Jennifer Granholm called them "a tragic coda" to a once-vibrant industry that until this week defined the Glasgow economy and served almost one-fifth of the city's employable population.%0a%0a"This is a sad day for the people of Glasgow," Granholm said to a crowd of part-time reporters and former assembly-line workers Tuesday. "Our city has a long, hallowed history of unemployment, and with these closings, we have lost a vital part of our economic and social fabric." %0a-------------------------------------%0a%0a%0aThen:%0a%0aFIVE YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF GIANT RAMPAGE%0a%0aFive years ago today the city of Edinburgh was rocked by a unexplained phenomenon, the overnight appearance of a 50 foot man-like creature, running amok. Only the timely intervention of Professor Norris Austerberry averted an almost-certain disaster, and city-leaders today commemorated the bravery shown on that fateful day. %0a%0aThere is an article about how it is five years to the day since the happenings of the first film, there is an interview with some experts, and a still of Norris with his hair all combed across, looking spoddish as ever, with a big medal for bravery. %0a%0a!!!Scene 3 - Norris' House%0a%0aThe doorbell rings, Norris gets up to answer it and it is Kelvin.%0a%0aNorris: "Hello Kelvin, how are you?"%0aKelvin: "Not bad thanks Norris"%0aNorris: "Would you like a drink?"%0aKelvin: "Yes, a cup of tea would be nice thanks"%0aNorris: "Tea? You don't want that, you want to try this, my new invention! It %0ahas all the benefits of tea AND coffee combined in one handy drink!"%0a%0aNorris pours some tea from a flask into a cup, would be good if it was a glass cup.%0a%0aKelvin looks suspiciously at it.%0a%0aNorris: "Try it! It's revolutionary! This is going to change the face of %0abeverages!"\\\%0a%0aKelvin gingerly takes a sip.\\\%0a%0a[Wobbly fade from scene to a dream sequence, which is an 10 second advert for Coftea, all psychadelic etc. finishing with a shot of Norris tasting it and exclaiming "It's great!"]%0a%0aSnap back to present, with Kelvin spitting out the drink violently!%0a%0aKelvin (annoyed): "Is this just tea AND coffee in the same drink?"\\%0aNorris (sheepishly): "Erm, yes. Yes it is."\\%0apause\\%0aNorris (aside): "and toothpaste."\\\%0a%0a%0a!!!Scene 4 - an attic door somewhere\\\%0a%0aThe attic door opens, and slowly a Norris clone climbs out. He looks around a %0abit, then whispers up into the attic "It's all clear!" and walks off. Another %0aNorris clone makes its way down and follows him, followed by another, and %0aanother....\\\%0a%0a!!!Scene 5 - A room full of desks and a flipchart.\\\%0a%0aThere is a Norris clone wearing number 001 on his labcoat in front of the flip %0achart, he is explaining a plan. His audience are a whole bunch of Norris clones %0awith different numbers, they are mostly not paying much attention, one is %0apicking his nose, one is asleep and snoring, one is scratching himself. Maybe %0aone is pinging rolled up bits of paper with a ruler at another one - we need to %0athink how to do that with multiple split screens. One of them (clone 007) is like a James Bond clone, he wears shades and tries to act cooler than the other clones, and when you see him, you hear some 007 like music.\\\%0a%0a001 is telling the other clones about how the original Norris clone managed to %0aduplicate himself during the night he was on the rampage, and for 5 years the %0aoriginal duplicate - 001 - has been making further copies, at a rate of 1 every %0a24 hours, until today, 5 years to the day that the orginal clone was %0ahorrifically butchered by Norris, they have a CLONE ARMY of almost 2000 clones! %0a(yeah yeah, with 3 digit numbers they only have enough for 999 clones - that %0acan be an in-joke) And mission number 1 is to avenge the death of their %0acreator, by destroying Norris!\\\%0a%0a!!!Scene 6 - Norris' House.\\\%0a%0aKelvin: "This place is in a terrible mess..."\\%0aNorris: "It's not been the same since Edwina left me..."\\%0aNorris picks up a photo frame and looks longingly at it (but we do not yet see %0athe photo)\\%0aKelvin: "It was a strange thing, how that happened..."\\%0aNorris: "Yes, I know he is your cousin and everything, but who would have %0athought that Melvin would have run off with my wife?"\\\%0a%0aWe see the photo he is holding, it is a faked up one of Edwina and Melvin.\\\%0a%0aNorris: "God, I miss him" (too obvious joke?)\\%0aKelvin: "Don't worry, I am your assistant now Norris, and I am just as good as %0aMelvin, if not a whole lot better! We are going to have to do something about %0athe mess of this flat though."\\\%0a%0aNorris puts down photo.\\\%0a%0aNorris: "Yes, I have been working on that! I have made this..." - drags out a %0asuper-hoover with a massive big nozzle on the end.\\\%0a%0aNorris: "It is my nuclear-powered vaccum cleaner, with 1000 times the suction %0aof a normal vacuum cleaner! This will make short work of this rubbish!"\\\%0a%0aNorris and Kelvin try out the nuclear vacuum and it sucks up all the rubbish, %0aplus various other bits of furniture, and blows some lightbulbs etc.\\\%0a%0aKelvin: "Maybe it's a bit too powerful?"\\%0aNorris: "Well is does seem to knock out any electrical appliances within a 2 %0amile radius, but that is just teething problems! A bit more shielding is all %0athat's required and it will be ready for market!"\\\%0a%0a%0a!!!Scene 7 - The clone army on the march%0a%0aLoads of shots of clones and that, %0awhich turns out to be on the news, it is Leroy TV!\\\%0a%0aLeroy: "Those are the horrific scenes from just a few moments ago. Details are %0astill sketchy, but we have here in the studio Chief Inspector Derek %0aStumpworthy. \\\%0a%0aChief Inspector, can you shed any light on the current situation?"\\\%0a%0aMe in a police uniform...\\\%0a%0a!!!Scene 8 - TV switches off, we are back in Norris' flat.\\\%0a%0aNorris: Blah blah, explanation, this is all my doing, we have to do something.\\%0aKelvin: Do we still have the normiliser gun from last time?\\\%0a%0aThey get the old normaliser gun out (or something similar) it is covered in %0adust, but still working, as Norris assures Kelvin. Kelvin decides to take along a %0abaseball bat just in case, there are an awful lot of them.\\\%0a%0a!!!Scene 9 - Outside\\\%0a%0aNorris and Kelvin set off to meet the clones, they travel on a motorbike, %0aKelvin driving, and Norris on the back.%0a%0a!!!Scene 10 - Outside %0a%0aThey spot some clones in the distance climbing over a fence and off they go %0aafter them.%0a%0aBy the time they get there, all the clones are gone except the last one who is %0astruggling over the fence, he has got a bit stuck. %0a%0aNorris: "Okay let him have it!"%0aKelvin shoots the normaliser at the clone, but the only effect is to get the %0aclone attention, it starts making its way towards Norris and Kelvin in a bit of a %0azombie like fashion!%0a%0aThere is panic as it gets closer and closer, and Norris takes the normiliser to %0afiddle with the controls. The clone closes in and grabs Norris by the neck %0atrying to strangle him!%0a%0aThere is a brief struggle, and then Kelvin whacks the clones head off with a %0abaseball bat!%0a%0aThere is a shot of a disembodied head and body lying on the grass, they are %0astill moving in a mechanical manner and there are all wires and that, plus mechanical %0agrinding noises!%0a%0aNorris: "Whew! Thanks Kelvin!"%0aKelvin: "I told you the normaliser wouldn't work after all this time"%0aNorris: "I think I know why it didn't work, these aren't proper clones, they %0aare robotic androids!"%0a%0aNorris bends over the body of the still moving andriod, its hands are like all %0afumbling and grasping, he opens up the labcoat and shirt, and there are all %0aelectronic lights and that inside!%0a%0aKelvin: "Robots?"%0aNorris (dismissively): "Yes, the original clone did not have the time to make a %0aproper cloning machine, he obviously made a cybernetic duplication device, an %0aaltogether much simpler contraption..."%0a%0aBlah blah we have to think up another plan...%0a%0aWe have to think of one quite quick - look!%0a%0aThe other clones have obviously heard the commotion and are on their way %0atowards Norris and Kelvin....Run!%0a%0a!!!Scene 11 - Leroy TV%0a%0aTV Update, maybe demands by the 001 clone etc.%0a%0a!!!Scene 12 %0a%0aNorris and Kelvin realise that they can utilise the side effect of the nuclear %0ahoover to short circuit the clone army.%0a%0a!!!Scene 13 %0a%0aSome scheme to get all the clones in the same place is hatched, and they short %0acircuit all the clones.%0a%0a!!!Scene 14%0a%0aNorris and Kelvin congratulating themselves, when we see from clone 001's eyes, %0ait is like the Terminator, all red with computer writing, and we see a shot of %0a001s eye glowing red as he REROUTES POWER.%0a%0aClone 001 comes back to life, and there is a bit of a battle maybe, where clone %0a001 reveals he is actually a common or garden android he has got super powers like %0aa hand that flips open to reveal a laser gun and all that! Or better, he takes a %0apen out of his lapel pocket that has been there all along, and it gets all big and %0abecomes a double-ended lightsabre!%0a%0aThere is a bit of a battle, where Kelvin eventually almost defeats 001, maybe %0ahis baseball bat gets cut in two or something during this, but anyway, 001 has %0alimbs missing and all that, and robo bits hanging out, and realises he cannot win and %0ahe grabs the automic hoover, straps it to his back, switches the switch on the %0aside from SUCK to BLOW, and it is a JETPAC! As he hovers away he turns back to %0aNorris and Kelvin and says "You have not heard the last of me!" before zooming off.%0a%0a!!!Scene 15 - Leroy TV Epilogue%0a%0aQuick Summary with Leroy, with stills from the events before, and Norris being %0aa hero again (even though it is Kelvin who saved the day really - Kelvin is %0atrying to get in shot in the background but Norris is blocking him out). %0a%0aOr maybe we do that as a paper headline review, with Leroy looking through the %0apapers and there will be serious ones, and really stupid ones.%0a%0a!!!Scene 16 Back to Norris' flat%0a%0aNorris and Kelvin having a cup of 'Coffea' with a big box of it in front of %0athem, they are having a talk and end on some witty pun.%0a%0a!!!THE END.%0a%0a(:html:)%0a%3ccenter>%0a%3cscript type="text/javascript">%3c!--%0agoogle_ad_client = "pub-5767714101223561";%0agoogle_ad_width = 728;%0agoogle_ad_height = 90;%0agoogle_ad_format = "728x90_as";%0agoogle_ad_type = "text_image";%0a//2007-09-12: GtBFilms%0agoogle_ad_channel = "8003625449";%0agoogle_ui_features = "rc:10";%0a//-->%0a%3c/script>%0a%3cscript type="text/javascript"%0a  src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js">%0a%3c/script>%0a%3c/center>%0a(:htmlend:)

diff:1140100492:1140100492:=1,219d0%0a%3c Here is the draft script of What a Mess 2! It still needs a lot of padding out though!%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Scene 1 - Norris' House%0a%3c %0a%3c Opening credits over a very similar scene to the start of "What A Mess!", except this time there is even MORE rubbish strewn about, and the camera tracks along it all, and as before there is the odd weird thing in there that is never explained, like the severed hand and that, the music will be the same as the previous film, except jazzed up a bit to make it more modern sounding, and we eventually get up to the sofa and pan along to find Norris lying there stuffing his face with....Frazzles.%0a%3c %0a%3c He is watching the news. Leroy TV begins...%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Scene 2 - Leroy TV%0a%3c %0a%3c Couple of humorous stories, then:%0a%3c %0a%3c FIVE YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF GIANT RAMPAGE%0a%3c There is an article about how it is five years to the day since the happenings of the first film, there is an interview with some experts, and a still of Norris with his hair all combed across, looking spoddish as ever, with a big medal for bravery. %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Scene 3 - Norris' House%0a%3c %0a%3c The doorbell rings, Norris gets up to answer it and it is Kelvin.%0a%3c %0a%3c Norris: "Hello Kelvin, how are you?"%0a%3c Kelvin: "Not bad thanks Norris"%0a%3c Norris: "Would you like a drink?"%0a%3c Kelvin: "Yes, a cup of tea would be nice thanks"%0a%3c Norris: "Tea? You don't want that, you want to try this, my new invention! It %0a%3c has all the benefits of tea AND coffee combined in one handy drink!"%0a%3c %0a%3c Norris pours some tea from a flask into a cup, would be good if it was a glass cup.%0a%3c %0a%3c Kelvin looks suspiciously at it.%0a%3c %0a%3c Norris: "Try it! It's revolutionary! This is going to change the face of %0a%3c beverages!"\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c Kelvin gingerly takes a sip.\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c Kelvin: "Is this just tea AND coffee in the same drink?"\\%0a%3c Norris (sheepishly): "Erm, yes. Yes it is."\\%0a%3c pause\\%0a%3c Norris (aside): "and toothpaste."\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c Kelvin: "This place is in a terrible mess..."\\%0a%3c Norris: "It's not been the same since Edwina left me..."\\%0a%3c Norris picks up a photo frame and looks longingly at it (but we do not yet see %0a%3c the photo)\\%0a%3c Kelvin: "It was a strange thing, how that happened..."\\%0a%3c Norris: "Yes, I know he is your cousin and everything, but who would have %0a%3c thought that Melvin would have run off with my wife?"\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c We see the photo he is holding, it is a faked up one of Edwina and Melvin.\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c Norris: "God, I miss him" (too obvious joke?)\\%0a%3c Kelvin: "Don't worry, I am your assistant now Norris, and I am just as good as %0a%3c Melvin, if not a whole lot better! We are going to have to do something about %0a%3c the mess of this flat though."\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c Norris puts down photo.\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c Norris: "Yes, I have been working on that! I have made this..." - drags out a %0a%3c super-hoover with a massive big nozzle on the end.\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c Norris: "It is my nuclear-powered vaccum cleaner, with 1000 times the suction %0a%3c of a normal vacuum cleaner! This will make short work of this rubbish!"\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c Norris and Kelvin try out the nuclear vacuum and it sucks up all the rubbish, %0a%3c plus various other bits of furniture, and blows some lightbulbs etc.\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c Kelvin: "Maybe it's a bit too powerful?"\\%0a%3c Norris: "Well is does seem to knock out any electrical appliances within a 2 %0a%3c mile radius, but that is just teething problems! A bit more shielding is all %0a%3c that's required and it will be ready for market!"\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Scene 4 - an attic door somewhere\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c The attic door opens, and slowly a Norris clone climbs out. He looks around a %0a%3c bit, then whispers up into the attic "It's all clear!" and walks off. Another %0a%3c Norris clone makes its way down and follows him, followed by another, and %0a%3c another....\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Scene 5 - A room full of desks and a flipchart.\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c There is a Norris clone wearing number 001 on his labcoat in front of the flip %0a%3c chart, he is explaining a plan. His audience are a whole bunch of Norris clones %0a%3c with different numbers, they are mostly not paying much attention, one is %0a%3c picking his nose, one is asleep and snoring, one is scratching himself. Maybe %0a%3c one is pinging rolled up bits of paper with a ruler at another one - we need to %0a%3c think how to do that with multiple split screens.\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c 001 is telling the other clones about how the original Norris clone managed to %0a%3c duplicate himself during the night he was on the rampage, and for 5 years the %0a%3c original duplicate - 001 - has been making further copies, at a rate of 1 every %0a%3c 24 hours, until today, 5 years to the day that the orginal clone was %0a%3c horrifically butchered by Norris, they have a CLONE ARMY of almost 2000 clones! %0a%3c (yeah yeah, with 3 digit numbers they only have enough for 999 clones - that %0a%3c can be an in-joke) And mission number 1 is to avenge the death of their %0a%3c creator, by destroying Norris!\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Scene 6 - Maybe have the hoover bit here, or a Leroy TV thing.\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Scene 7 - The clone army on the march%0a%3c %0a%3c Loads of shots of clones and that, %0a%3c which turns out to be on the news, it is Leroy TV!\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c Leroy: "Those are the horrific scenes from just a few moments ago. Details are %0a%3c still sketchy, but we have here in the studio Chief Inspector Derek %0a%3c Stumpworthy. \\\%0a%3c %0a%3c Chief Inspector, can you shed any light on the current situation?"\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c Me in a police uniform...\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Scene 8 - TV switches off, we are back in Norris' flat.\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c Norris: Blah blah, explanation, this is all my doing, we have to do something.\\%0a%3c Kelvin: Do we still have the normiliser gun from last time?\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c They get the old normaliser gun out (or something similar) it is covered in %0a%3c dust, but still working, as Norris assures Kelvin. Kelvin decides to take along a %0a%3c baseball bat just in case, there are an awful lot of them.\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Scene 9 - Outside\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c Norris and Kelvin set off to meet the clones, they travel on a motorbike, %0a%3c Kelvin driving, and Norris on the back.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Scene 10 - Outside %0a%3c %0a%3c They spot some clones in the distance climbing over a fence and off they go %0a%3c after them.%0a%3c %0a%3c By the time they get there, all the clones are gone except the last one who is %0a%3c struggling over the fence, he has got a bit stuck. %0a%3c %0a%3c Norris: "Okay let him have it!"%0a%3c Kelvin shoots the normaliser at the clone, but the only effect is to get the %0a%3c clone attention, it starts making its way towards Norris and Kelvin in a bit of a %0a%3c zombie like fashion!%0a%3c %0a%3c There is panic as it gets closer and closer, and Norris takes the normiliser to %0a%3c fiddle with the controls. The clone closes in and grabs Norris by the neck %0a%3c trying to strangle him!%0a%3c %0a%3c There is a brief struggle, and then Kelvin whacks the clones head off with a %0a%3c baseball bat!%0a%3c %0a%3c There is a shot of a disembodied head and body lying on the grass, they are %0a%3c still moving in a mechanical manner and there are all wires and that, plus mechanical %0a%3c grinding noises!%0a%3c %0a%3c Norris: "Whew! Thanks Kelvin!"%0a%3c Kelvin: "I tolf you the normaliser wouldn't work after all this time"%0a%3c Norris: "I think I know why it didn't work, these aren't proper clones, they %0a%3c are robotic androids!"%0a%3c %0a%3c Norris bends over the body of the still moving andriod, its hands are like all %0a%3c fumbling and grasping, he opens up the labcoat and shirt, and there are all %0a%3c electronic lights and that inside!%0a%3c %0a%3c Kelvin: "Robots?"%0a%3c Norris (dismissively): "Yes, the original clone did not have the time to make a %0a%3c proper cloning machine, he obviously made a cybernetic duplication device, an %0a%3c altogether much simpler contraption..."%0a%3c %0a%3c Blah blah we have to think up another plan...%0a%3c %0a%3c We have to think of one quite quick - look!%0a%3c %0a%3c The other clones have obviously heard the commotion and are on their way %0a%3c towards Norris and Kelvin....Run!%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Scene 11 - Leroy TV%0a%3c %0a%3c TV Update, maybe demands by the 001 clone etc.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Scene 12 %0a%3c %0a%3c Norris and Kelvin realise that they can utilise the side effect of the nuclear %0a%3c hoover to short circuit the clone army.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Scene 13 %0a%3c %0a%3c Some scheme to get all the clones in the same place is hatched, and they short %0a%3c circuit all the clones.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Scene 14%0a%3c %0a%3c Norris and Kelvin congratulating themselves, when we see from clone 001's eyes, %0a%3c it is like the Terminator, all red with computer writing, and we see a shot of %0a%3c 001s eye glowing red as he REROUTES POWER.%0a%3c %0a%3c Clone 001 comes back to life, and there is a bit of a battle maybe, where clone %0a%3c 001 reveals he is actually a common or garden android he has got super powers like %0a%3c a hand that flips open to reveal a laser gun and all that! Or better, he takes a %0a%3c pen out of his lapel pocket that has been there all along, and it gets all big and %0a%3c becomes a double-ended lightsabre!%0a%3c %0a%3c There is a bit of a battle, where Kelvin eventually almost defeats 001, maybe %0a%3c his baseball bat gets cut in two or something during this, but anyway, 001 has %0a%3c limbs missing and all that, and robo bits hanging out, and realises he cannot win and %0a%3c he grabs the automic hoover, straps it to his back, switches the switch on the %0a%3c side from SUCK to BLOW, and it is a JETPAC! As he hovers away he turns back to %0a%3c Norris and Kelvin and says "You have not heard the last of me!" before zooming off.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Scene 15 - Leroy TV Epilogue%0a%3c %0a%3c Quick Summary with Leroy, with stills from the events before, and Norris being %0a%3c a hero again (even though it is Kelvin who saved the day really - Kelvin is %0a%3c trying to get in shot in the background but Norris is blocking him out). %0a%3c %0a%3c Or maybe we do that as a paper headline review, with Leroy looking through the %0a%3c papers and there will be serious ones, and really stupid ones.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Scene 16 Back to Norris' flat%0a%3c %0a%3c Norris and Kelvin having a cup of 'Coffea' with a big box of it in front of %0a%3c them, they are having a talk and end on some witty pun.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!THE END.%0a
