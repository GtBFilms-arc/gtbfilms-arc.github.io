Leroy TV begins...%0a%0a!!!Scene 2 - Leroy TV%0a%0aCouple of humorous stories e.g:%0a%0aCrazy invention adverts? A clock so small, you can strap it to your wrist! Stuff that's already been invented.%0a%0a-------------------------------------%0aThousands Lose Jobs As Glasgow Unemployment Offices Close%0a%0aIn another devastating blow to Glasgow's already fragile economy, the Unemployment Agency of the city %0aof Glasgow today permanently shuttered nine of its branch offices, leaving more than 8,500 %0aunemployment employees unemployed.%0a%0aAnnouncing the closings at a press conference, Glasgow council spokesperson Jennifer Granholm %0acalled them "a tragic coda" to a once-vibrant industry that until this week defined the Glasgow %0aeconomy and served almost one-fifth of the city's employable population.%0a%0a"This is a sad day for the people of Glasgow," Granholm said to a crowd of part-time reporters %0aand former assembly-line workers Tuesday. "Our city has a long, hallowed history of unemployment, %0aand with these closings, we have lost a vital part of our economic and social fabric." %0a-------------------------------------%0a%0a%0aThen:%0a%0aFIVE YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF GIANT RAMPAGE%0a%0aFive years ago today the city of Edinburgh was rocked by a unexplained phenomenon, the overnight %0aappearance of a 50 foot man-like creature, running amok. Only the timely intervention of Professor %0aNorris Austerberry averted an almost-certain disaster, and city-leaders today commemorated the %0abravery shown on that fateful day. %0a%0aThere is an article about how it is five years to the day since the happenings of the first film, %0athere is an interview with some experts, and a still of Norris with his hair all combed across, %0alooking spoddish as ever, with a big medal for bravery. %0a%0a!!!Scene 3 - Norris' House%0a%0aA letter gets posted through the front door, Norris gets up from the sofa and goes to the door and picks up the letter, he opens it and starts to read it. A narrator (not Norris) reads the contents as we see Norris%0areading it.%0a%0aLetter says:%0a"Dear Professor Austerberry, %0a %0aThankyou for your recent application to register as a government-regulated user of Plutonium. I am pleased to inform you that your application to store and utilise 1 kilogram of the Plutonium-239 isotope has been provisionally approved. %0a%0aDue to the interest of public safety our agreement is conditional on your work being observed by a qualified Government Inspector, who will monitor your methods and techniques to ensure adherence to relevant health and safety legislation. %0a %0aA Government Inspector has already been assigned to you, and will be with you shortly. Your Inspector is named "Horace Noteworthy". %0a %0aWe trust that these requirements will be acceptable to you.%0a %0aYours sincerely,%0a %0aRoger Mondex"%0a%0a%0aThe doorbell rings just as Norris finishes reading the letter, Norris answers it and it is Horace in a suit and with specs on and with a notepad under his arm. He is the image of efficiency.%0a\\\%0aNorris: "Hello, you must be from the Government?"\\%0aHorace: "Yes, Horace Noteworthy, Government Inspector, I take it _you_ (looks Norris up and down distainfully) must be Professor Norris Austerberry?"\\%0aNorris: "Yes that's me, I suppose you'd better come in"\\\%0a%0aHorace comes into the house and they make their way through to the livingroom, which is still full of mess.\\\%0a%0aNorris:"Well I suppose you're going to be here for a while, would you like something to drink?"\\%0aHorace: "Yes, a cup of tea would be nice thanks"\\%0aNorris: "Tea? You don't want that, you want to try this, my new invention! It has all the benefits of tea AND coffee combined in one handy drink!"\\\%0a%0aNorris pours some tea from a flask into a cup, would be good if it was a glass cup.\\\%0a%0aHorace looks suspiciously at it.\\\%0a%0aNorris: "Try it! It's revolutionary! This is going to change the face of beverages!"\\\%0a%0aHorace gingerly takes a sip.\\\%0a%0a[Wobbly fade from scene to a dream sequence, which is an 10 second advert for Coftea, all psychadelic etc. finishing with a shot of Norris tasting it and exclaiming "It's great!"]\\\%0a%0aSnap back to present, with Horace spitting out the drink violently!\\\%0a%0aHorace (annoyed): "Is this just tea AND coffee in the same drink?"\\%0aNorris (sheepishly): "Erm, yes. Yes it is."\\%0apause\\%0aNorris (aside): "and toothpaste."\\\%0a%0aHorace looks annoyed, and furiously scribbles some notes in his notepad.%0a%0a!!!Scene 4 - an attic door somewhere\\\%0a%0aThe attic door opens, and slowly a Norris clone climbs out. He looks around a %0abit, then whispers up into the attic "It's all clear!" and walks off. Another %0aNorris clone makes its way down and follows him, followed by another, and %0aanother....\\\%0a%0a!!!Scene 5 - A room full of desks and a flipchart.\\\%0a%0aThere is a Norris clone wearing number 001 on his labcoat in front of the flip %0achart, he is explaining a plan. His audience are a whole bunch of Norris clones %0awith different numbers, they are mostly not paying much attention, one is %0apicking his nose, one is asleep and snoring, one is scratching himself. Maybe %0aone is pinging rolled up bits of paper with a ruler at another one - we need to %0athink how to do that with multiple split screens. One of them (clone 007) is like a James Bond clone, he wears shades and tries to act cooler than the other clones, and when you see him, you hear some 007 like music.\\\%0a%0a001 is telling the other clones about how the original Norris clone managed to %0aduplicate himself during the night he was on the rampage, and for 5 years the %0aoriginal duplicate - 001 - has been making further copies, at a rate of 1 every %0a24 hours, until today, 5 years to the day that the orginal clone was %0ahorrifically butchered by Norris, they have a CLONE ARMY of almost 2000 clones! %0a(yeah yeah, with 3 digit numbers they only have enough for 999 clones - that %0acan be an in-joke) And mission number 1 is to avenge the death of their %0acreator, by destroying Norris!\\\%0a%0a!!!Scene 6A - Norris' House.\\\%0a%0aHorace: "This place is in a terrible mess..."\\%0aNorris: "It's not been the same since Edwina left me..."\\%0aNorris picks up a photo frame and looks longingly at it (but we do not yet see %0athe photo)\\%0aHorace: "I'm sorry, I didn't know..."\\%0aNorris: "That's okay, it's not your fault, but who could have guessed that Melvin would have run off with my wife?"\\\%0a%0aWe see the photo he is holding, it is a faked up one of Edwina and Melvin.\\\%0a%0aNorris: "God, I miss him" (too obvious joke?)\\%0aHorace: "You need to keep yourself busy, take your mind off it, you should tidy up this mess for a start!"\\\%0a%0aNorris puts down photo.\\\%0a%0aNorris: (excitedly) "Yes, I have been working on that! I have made this..." - drags out a super-hoover with a massive big nozzle on the end.\\\%0a%0aNorris: "It is my Plutonium-powered vacuum cleaner, the Norisuck 9000! It's a revolutionary new concept in vacuum cleaning! It doesn't just suck up rubbish, it ERASES IT FROM THE FABRIC OF TIME AND SPACE!"%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a||border=1 width=60%25 align=left%0a||''Norris doesn't go for the obvious solutions to problems, right? e.g. instead of tidying his flat the obvious way in WAM1 he builds a cloning machine. Well the nuclear hoover doesn't just hoover stuff into a bag because that would have to be emptied, which is inconvenient. No, it erases things from time! So crisp bags that are lying on the carpet suddenly have never existed. Of course the technology is new and he is still having some teething problems with it, like shorting out other electrical equipment. And maybe he can only erase small things.''||||%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]][[%3c%3c]]%0a||border=1 width=60%25 align=left%0a||''If it erases it all from time (so he thinks) we can do a cross-fade shot of rubbish with the same shot with the rubbish removed. Locking the camera position between shots should just make the rubbish all fade away! We could also cut to some close-ups of rubbish fading, and do them with a blue screen - so on the close-up you can see that it doesn't just fade, it sort of shimmers and disappears. On the long shot it would just fade, but that is fine because I only mean like a slight shimmer.''||||%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]][[%3c%3c]]%0aNorris and Horace try out the nuclear vacuum and it slowly erases all the rubbish in the room, as Norris points the nozzle towards them. There is a sort of wide beam that comes out the end of the nozzle, and a lot of electrical crackling lighning around it, and also electrical lighning round the body of the vacuum cleaner, eventually some lightbulbs blow etc.\\\%0a%0aHorace: (looking at a broken light-bulb) "Maybe it's a bit too powerful?"\\%0aNorris: "Well is does seem to knock out any electrical appliances within a 2 %0amile radius, but those are just teething problems! A bit more shielding is all %0athat's required and it will be ready for market!"\\\%0a%0aHorace scribbles down some notes in his notepad, and Norris eyes him suspiciously.%0a%0a%0a!!!Scene 6B - Norris' House.\\\%0a%0aThe opening title sequence for the second time with the same music and Norris lying on the sofa eating Frazzles, and the camera pans along but this time the flat is REALLY tidy.  Norris presses the TV remote control and we go straight into scene 7.\\\%0a%0a%0a!!!Scene 7 - The clone army on the march%0a%0aLoads of shots of clones and that, %0awhich turns out to be on the news, it is Leroy TV!\\\%0a%0aLeroy: "Those are the horrific scenes from just a few moments ago. Details are %0astill sketchy, but we have here in the studio Chief Inspector Derek %0aStumpworthy. \\\%0a%0aChief Inspector, can you shed any light on the current situation?"\\\%0a%0aMe in a police uniform...\\\%0a%0aDerek Stumpworthy: "Certainly. We have completed the 50-page risk assessment that is mandatory before we allow police officers near the incident. We are just starting the ecological impact analysis and ensuring that we have the right diversity of police officers on the scene."%0a%0aLeroy: "And what about actually trying to stop this mob from wrecking the city?"%0a%0aDerek Stumpworthy: "Yes that is important, but first we have to ensure that our officers have been trained to deal with all possible outcomes, and that their training reports are all up to date."%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a!!!Scene 8 - TV switches off, we are back in Norris' flat.\\\%0a%0aNorris: Blah blah, explanation, this is all my doing, we have to do something.\\%0aHorace: What did you do the last time your clone was running amok?\\\%0aNorris: The Normaliser gun! It must still be around here somewhere.. (starts rummaging around in things)\\%0a%0a%0aThey get the old normaliser gun out (or something similar) it is covered in a thick layer of dust, but still working, as Norris assures Horace. Horace decides to take along a baseball bat just in case, there are an awful lot of them.\\\%0a%0aAdd in a bit about the Cloak of Invisibility here. Norris has discovered this device in his lab, he doesn't know where it came from, he reckons someone maybe left it there by accident. It renders the wearer totally invisible. They decide to make use of that to approach the Clone base.%0a%0a%0a!!!Scene 9 - Outside\\\%0a%0aNorris and Horace set off to meet the clones, they travel on a motorbike, Horace driving, and Norris on the back.%0a%0a!!!Scene 10 - Outside %0a%0aNorris puts on the cloak of invisibility. Like all of his inventions, it has a fatal flaw, you can see his feet at the bottom of it. Norris observes some clones climbing over a fence. He tells Horace to stay where he is, while he takes a closer look at them.%0a%0aHe observes the clones, unseen due to the cloak, and most of the clones wander off, leaving only one.%0a%0aThe clone that is left is looking around and sees Norris' disembodied feet moving around, it advances on Norris and pulls off the cloak!%0a%0aNorris: "Oh-oh! Help Horace!"%0aHorace runs over and shoots the normaliser at the clone, but the only effect is to annoy the clone, it starts to struggle with Norris in a zombie-like fashion!%0a%0aThere is panic as it gets closer and closer, it grabs Norris by the neck and starts to strangle him! (Although this scene has the same actor in it twice, we film it by only seeing the back of Norrisclone's head and the normal view of Norris, or vice versa or possibly both angles, and a different actor plays the character we can't see the face of.  This worked well in the WAM2 film trailer and in the Scooby film.)%0a%0aThere is a brief struggle, and then Horace whacks the clones head off with a %0abaseball bat!%0a%0aThere is a shot of a disembodied head and body lying on the grass, they are %0astill moving in a mechanical manner and there are all wires and that, plus mechanical %0agrinding noises!%0a%0aNorris: "Whew! Thanks Horace!"%0aHorace: "I told you the normaliser wouldn't work after all this time"%0aNorris: "I think I know why it didn't work, these aren't proper clones, they %0aare robotic androids!"%0a%0aNorris bends over the body of the still moving android, its hands are like all %0afumbling and grasping, he opens up the labcoat and shirt, and there are all %0aelectronic lights and that inside!%0a%0aHorace: "Robots?"%0aNorris (dismissively): "Yes, the original clone did not have the time to make a %0aproper cloning machine, he obviously made a cybernetic duplication device, an %0aaltogether much simpler contraption..."%0a%0aBlah blah we have to think up another plan...%0a%0aWe have to think of one quite quick - look!%0a%0aThe other clones have obviously heard the commotion and are on their way %0atowards Norris and Horace....Run!%0a%0a!!!Scene 11 - Leroy TV%0a%0aTV Update, maybe demands by the 001 clone etc.%0a%0a!!!Scene 12 %0a%0aNorris and Horace realise that they can utilise the side effect of the nuclear %0ahoover to short circuit the clone army.%0a%0a!!!Scene 13 %0a%0aNorris realises that he can utilise the side effect of the nuclear hoover to short-circuit the clone/robot army. %0a%0aHe realises he can use the robot head signal receiver to track the location of the clone/robot production facility.%0a%0aIt could be quite funny if he discusses with the assistant how they will use the cloak in the next bit, he goes off to get it leaving the assistant waiting, then Norris comes back with nothing and mumbles that he can't find it, and the assistant doesn't quite hear and so Norris has to repeat himself and sheepishly admit that it's a bit of a design flaw when you can't find an invisible item.%0a%0aThey attacks the clone/robot facility with the nuclear hoover and short-circuit all the clones/robots!%0a%0a!!!Scene 14%0a%0aNorris and Horace congratulating themselves, when we see from clone 001's eyes, %0ait is like the Terminator, all red with computer writing, and we see a shot of %0a001s eye glowing red as he REROUTES POWER.%0a%0aClone 001 comes back to life, and there is a bit of a battle maybe, where clone %0a001 reveals he is actually a common or garden android he has got super powers like %0aa hand that flips open to reveal a laser gun and all that! Or better, he takes a %0apen out of his lapel pocket that has been there all along, and it gets all big and %0abecomes a double-ended lightsabre!%0a%0aThere is a bit of a battle, where Horace eventually almost defeats 001, maybe %0ahis baseball bat gets cut in two or something during this, but anyway, 001 has %0alimbs missing and all that, and robo bits hanging out, and realises he cannot win and %0ahe grabs the automic hoover, straps it to his back, switches the switch on the %0aside from SUCK to BLOW, and it is a JETPAC! As he hovers away he turns back to %0aNorris and Horace and says "You have not heard the last of me!" before zooming off.%0a%0a!!!Scene 15 - Leroy TV Epilogue%0a%0aQuick Summary with Leroy, with stills from the events before, and Norris being %0aa hero again (even though it is Horace who saved the day really - Horace is %0atrying to get in shot in the background but Norris is blocking him out). %0a%0aOr maybe we do that as a paper headline review, with Leroy looking through the %0apapers and there will be serious ones, and really stupid ones.%0a%0a!!!Scene 16 Back to Norris' flat%0a%0aNorris and Horace having a cup of 'Coffea' with a big box of it in front of %0athem, they are having a talk and end on some witty pun.%0a%0aAs they are sitting there bits of rubbish start rematerialising around them one by one!%0a%0aHorace: (picking up an old crisp packet that has just materialised on top of his cup of tea) "What's happening?"%0a%0aNorris: "Oh-oh, It looks like Einstein was right, you CAN'T erase things from time, you can only push them forward a bit!"%0a%0aAnd that's the end with them sitting there and more and more rubbish materialising around them.%0a%0a(Perhaps it turns out that the hoover rubbish from time as he thinks, it is transporting them into the future so they only disappear for a while and then come back.... hmmmm......... and therefore the clones come back for WAM3 even when he thinks he has erased them, and he only realises at the end of WAM2 when he gets back home and finds all the rubbish has reappeared in his flat, and it is left unsaid that this therefore means that the clones are about to reappear.  Maybe.)%0a%0a!!!THE END.%0a%0a%0a---Continuity with WAM3---%0a%0aThe cloak of invisibility can be an item which Norris actually invents in WAM3 and comes back in time and accidentally leaves it behind (when you put it down when switched on you can't see where you left it) at the start of WAM2.%0a%0aWhy is a clone left behind to guard in scene 10? Norris in WAM3 could cause this to happen somehow.%0a%0aIn the final battle scene where the clones are short-circuited, Norris from WAM3 can appear in the background. He is there to make sure the hoover works as planned - i.e. it takes out all the clones, because in the start of WAM3, he first goes back and fixes the hoover, to prevent the build-up of all the rubbish all over the place in WAM3. By doing this he inadvertently fixes the EMP side-effect of the hoover, thus changing history and making it so that it doesn't work as we saw at the end of WAM2. In WAM3 he needs to come back to this point in history to re-apply the side effect of the hoover, so that the clones are killed off, thus resetting the status-quo.%0a%0a%0a---Other Ideas---%0a%0afrom	Alan Brown %0ato	Andrew Bawn %0adate	11 August 2008 16:39%0asubject	Invisibility%0a	%0aInteresting article on the BBC the day, about a cloak of invisibility:%0a%0ahttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7553061.stm%0a%0aMaybe we could incorporate something like this into WAM2 as one of Norris's other inventions. (The original WAM was topical with references to cloning).%0a%0aWouldn't necessarily make this integral to the plot, but it would be an easy effect to do.%0a%0aHTH%0a%0aGtB%0a%0a%0a%0a(:html:)%0a%3ccenter>%0a%3cscript type="text/javascript">%3c!--%0agoogle_ad_client = "pub-5767714101223561";%0agoogle_ad_width = 728;%0agoogle_ad_height = 90;%0agoogle_ad_format = "728x90_as";%0agoogle_ad_type = "text_image";%0a//2007-09-12: GtBFilms%0agoogle_ad_channel = "8003625449";%0agoogle_ui_features = "rc:10";%0a//-->%0a%3c/script>%0a%3cscript type="text/javascript"%0a  src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js">%0a%3c/script>%0a%3c/center>%0a(:htmlend:)

Norris in WAM3 could cause this to happen somehow.%0a%3c %0a%3c In the final battle scene where the clones are short-circuited, Norris from WAM3 can appear in the background. He is there to make sure the hoover works as planned - i.e. it takes out all the clones, because in the start of WAM3, he first goes back and fixes the hoover, to prevent the build-up of all the rubbish all over the place in WAM3. By doing this he inadvertently fixes the EMP side-effect of the hoover, thus changing history and making it so that it doesn't work as we saw at the end of WAM2. In WAM3 he needs to come back to this point in history to re-apply the side effect of the hoover, so that the clones are killed off, thus resetting the status-quo.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a

Leroy TV begins...%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Scene 2 - Leroy TV%0a%3c %0a%3c Couple of humorous stories e.g:%0a%3c %0a%3c -------------------------------------%0a%3c Thousands Lose Jobs As Glasgow Unemployment Offices Close%0a%3c %0a%3c In another devastating blow to Glasgow's already fragile economy, the Unemployment Agency of the city %0a%3c of Glasgow today permanently shuttered nine of it's branch offices, leaving more than 8,500 %0a%3c unemployment employees unemployed.%0a%3c %0a%3c Announcing the closings at a press conference, Glasgow council spokesperson Jennifer Granholm %0a%3c called them "a tragic coda" to a once-vibrant industry that until this week defined the Glasgow %0a%3c economy and served almost one-fifth of the city's employable population.%0a%3c %0a%3c "This is a sad day for the people of Glasgow," Granholm said to a crowd of part-time reporters %0a%3c and former assembly-line workers Tuesday. "Our city has a long, hallowed history of unemployment, %0a%3c and with these closings, we have lost a vital part of our economic and social fabric." %0a%3c -------------------------------------%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Then:%0a%3c %0a%3c FIVE YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF GIANT RAMPAGE%0a%3c %0a%3c Five years ago today the city of Edinburgh was rocked by a unexplained phenomenon, the overnight %0a%3c appearance of a 50 foot man-like creature, running amok. Only the timely intervention of Professor %0a%3c Norris Austerberry averted an almost-certain disaster, and city-leaders today commemorated the %0a%3c bravery shown on that fateful day. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is an article about how it is five years to the day since the happenings of the first film, %0a%3c there is an interview with some experts, and a still of Norris with his hair all combed across, %0a%3c looking spoddish as ever, with a big medal for bravery. %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Scene 3 - Norris' House%0a%3c %0a%3c A letter gets posted through the front door, Norris gets up from the sofa and goes to the door and picks up the letter, he opens it and starts to read it. A narrator (not Norris) reads the contents as we see Norris%0a%3c reading it.%0a%3c %0a%3c Letter says:%0a%3c  "Dear Professor Austerberry, %0a%3c  %0a%3c  Thankyou for your recent application to register as a government-regulated %0a%3c  user of Plutonium. I am familiar with your previous research, and I am %0a%3c  pleased to inform you that in light of your current research project requirements,%0a%3c  your application to store and utilise 1 kilogram of the  Plutonium-239 isotope %0a%3c  has been provisionally approved.%0a%3c  %0a%3c  Due to the precarious nature of this element, and safety concerns on it's use,%0a%3c  our agreement is  conditional on your work being observed at all times by a %0a%3c  qualified Government Inspector, who will monitor your methods and techniques,%0a%3c  to ensure adherence to relevant health and safety legislation. %0a%3c  %0a%3c  As we are aware that you have already taken receipt of the Plutonium, a Government %0a%3c  Inspector has already been assigned to you, and will be with you shortly. %0a%3c  Your Inspector is named "Horace Noteworthy". %0a%3c  %0a%3c  We trust that these requirements will be acceptable to you,%0a%3c  %0a%3c  Yours Sincerely,%0a%3c  %0a%3c  Roger Mondex"%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The doorbell rings just as Norris finishes reading the letter, Norris answers it and it is Horace in a suit and with specs on and with a notepad under his arm. He is the image of efficiency.%0a%3c \\\%0a%3c Norris: "Hello, you must be from the Government?"\\%0a%3c Horace: "Yes, Horace Noteworthy, Government Inspector, I take it _you_ (looks Norris up and down distainfully) must be Professor Norris Austerberry?"\\%0a%3c Norris: "Yes that's me, I suppose you'd better come in"\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c Horace comes into the house and they make their way through to the livingroom, which is still full of mess.\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c Norris:"Well I suppose you're going to be here for a while, would you like something to drink?"\\%0a%3c Horace: "Yes, a cup of tea would be nice thanks"\\%0a%3c Norris: "Tea? You don't want that, you want to try this, my new invention! It has all the benefits of tea AND coffee combined in one handy drink!"\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c Norris pours some tea from a flask into a cup, would be good if it was a glass cup.\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c Horace looks suspiciously at it.\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c Norris: "Try it! It's revolutionary! This is going to change the face of beverages!"\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c Horace gingerly takes a sip.\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c [Wobbly fade from scene to a dream sequence, which is an 10 second advert for Coftea, all psychadelic etc. finishing with a shot of Norris tasting it and exclaiming "It's great!"]\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c Snap back to present, with Horace spitting out the drink violently!\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c Horace (annoyed): "Is this just tea AND coffee in the same drink?"\\%0a%3c Norris (sheepishly): "Erm, yes. Yes it is."\\%0a%3c pause\\%0a%3c Norris (aside): "and toothpaste."\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Scene 4 - an attic door somewhere\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c The attic door opens, and slowly a Norris clone climbs out. He looks around a %0a%3c bit, then whispers up into the attic "It's all clear!" and walks off. Another %0a%3c Norris clone makes its way down and follows him, followed by another, and %0a%3c another....\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Scene 5 - A room full of desks and a flipchart.\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c There is a Norris clone wearing number 001 on his labcoat in front of the flip %0a%3c chart, he is explaining a plan. His audience are a whole bunch of Norris clones %0a%3c with different numbers, they are mostly not paying much attention, one is %0a%3c picking his nose, one is asleep and snoring, one is scratching himself. Maybe %0a%3c one is pinging rolled up bits of paper with a ruler at another one - we need to %0a%3c think how to do that with multiple split screens. One of them (clone 007) is like a James Bond clone, he wears shades and tries to act cooler than the other clones, and when you see him, you hear some 007 like music.\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c 001 is telling the other clones about how the original Norris clone managed to %0a%3c duplicate himself during the night he was on the rampage, and for 5 years the %0a%3c original duplicate - 001 - has been making further copies, at a rate of 1 every %0a%3c 24 hours, until today, 5 years to the day that the orginal clone was %0a%3c horrifically butchered by Norris, they have a CLONE ARMY of almost 2000 clones! %0a%3c (yeah yeah, with 3 digit numbers they only have enough for 999 clones - that %0a%3c can be an in-joke) And mission number 1 is to avenge the death of their %0a%3c creator, by destroying Norris!\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Scene 6 - Norris' House.\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c Horace: "This place is in a terrible mess..."\\%0a%3c Norris: "It's not been the same since Edwina left me..."\\%0a%3c Norris picks up a photo frame and looks longingly at it (but we do not yet see %0a%3c the photo)\\%0a%3c Horace: "I'm sorry, I didn't know..."\\%0a%3c Norris: "That's okay, it's not your fault, but who could have guessed that Melvin would have run off with my wife?"\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c We see the photo he is holding, it is a faked up one of Edwina and Melvin.\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c Norris: "God, I miss him" (too obvious joke?)\\%0a%3c Horace: "You need to keep yourself busy, take your mind off it, you should tidy up this mess for a start!"\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c Norris puts down photo.\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c Norris: (excitedly) "Yes, I have been working on that! I have made this..." - drags out a super-hoover with a massive big nozzle on the end.\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c Norris: "It is my Plutonium-powered vaccum cleaner, the Norisuck 9000! It's a revolutionary new concept in vacuum cleaning! It doesn't just suck up rubbish, it ERASES IT FROM THE FABRIC OF TIME AND SPACE!"\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ||border=1 width=90%25 align=left%0a%3c || %0a%3c Norris doesn't go for the obvious solutions to problems, right? e.g. instead of tidying his flat the obvious way in WAM1 he builds a cloning machine.\\%0a%3c Well the nuclear hoover doesn't just hoover stuff into a bag because that would have to be emptied, which is inconvenient.\\\%0a%3c No, it erases things from time!\\\%0a%3c So crisp bags that are lying on the carpet suddenly have never existed. Of course the technology is new and he is still having some teething%0a%3c problems with it, like shorting out other electrical equipment. And maybe he can only erase small things. %0a%3c %0a%3c If it erases it all from time (so he thinks) we can do a cross-fade shot of rubbish with the same shot with the rubbish removed. Locking the camera position between shots should just make the rubbish all fade away! We could also cut to some close-ups of rubbish fading, and do them with a blue screen - so on the close-up you can see that it doesn't just fade, it sort of shimmers and disappears. On the long shot it would just fade, but that is fine because I only mean like a slight shimmer.%0a%3c ||||%0a%3c %0a%3c Norris and Horace try out the nuclear vacuum and it sucks up all the rubbish, %0a%3c plus various other bits of furniture, and blows some lightbulbs etc.\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c Horace: "Maybe it's a bit too powerful?"\\%0a%3c Norris: "Well is does seem to knock out any electrical appliances within a 2 %0a%3c mile radius, but that is just teething problems! A bit more shielding is all %0a%3c that's required and it will be ready for market!"\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Scene 7 - The clone army on the march%0a%3c %0a%3c Loads of shots of clones and that, %0a%3c which turns out to be on the news, it is Leroy TV!\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c Leroy: "Those are the horrific scenes from just a few moments ago. Details are %0a%3c still sketchy, but we have here in the studio Chief Inspector Derek %0a%3c Stumpworthy. \\\%0a%3c %0a%3c Chief Inspector, can you shed any light on the current situation?"\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c Me in a police uniform...\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Scene 8 - TV switches off, we are back in Norris' flat.\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c Norris: Blah blah, explanation, this is all my doing, we have to do something.\\%0a%3c Horace: Do we still have the normiliser gun from last time?\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c They get the old normaliser gun out (or something similar) it is covered in %0a%3c dust, but still working, as Norris assures Horace. Horace decides to take along a %0a%3c baseball bat just in case, there are an awful lot of them.\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Scene 9 - Outside\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c Norris and Horace set off to meet the clones, they travel on a motorbike, %0a%3c Horace driving, and Norris on the back.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Scene 10 - Outside %0a%3c %0a%3c They spot some clones in the distance climbing over a fence and off they go %0a%3c after them.%0a%3c %0a%3c By the time they get there, all the clones are gone except the last one who is %0a%3c struggling over the fence, he has got a bit stuck. %0a%3c %0a%3c Norris: "Okay let him have it!"%0a%3c Horace shoots the normaliser at the clone, but the only effect is to get the %0a%3c clone attention, it starts making its way towards Norris and Horace in a bit of a %0a%3c zombie like fashion!%0a%3c %0a%3c There is panic as it gets closer and closer, and Norris takes the normiliser to %0a%3c fiddle with the controls. The clone closes in and grabs Norris by the neck %0a%3c trying to strangle him!%0a%3c %0a%3c There is a brief struggle, and then Horace whacks the clones head off with a %0a%3c baseball bat!%0a%3c %0a%3c There is a shot of a disembodied head and body lying on the grass, they are %0a%3c still moving in a mechanical manner and there are all wires and that, plus mechanical %0a%3c grinding noises!%0a%3c %0a%3c Norris: "Whew! Thanks Horace!"%0a%3c Horace: "I told you the normaliser wouldn't work after all this time"%0a%3c Norris: "I think I know why it didn't work, these aren't proper clones, they %0a%3c are robotic androids!"%0a%3c %0a%3c Norris bends over the body of the still moving andriod, its hands are like all %0a%3c fumbling and grasping, he opens up the labcoat and shirt, and there are all %0a%3c electronic lights and that inside!%0a%3c %0a%3c Horace: "Robots?"%0a%3c Norris (dismissively): "Yes, the original clone did not have the time to make a %0a%3c proper cloning machine, he obviously made a cybernetic duplication device, an %0a%3c altogether much simpler contraption..."%0a%3c %0a%3c Blah blah we have to think up another plan...%0a%3c %0a%3c We have to think of one quite quick - look!%0a%3c %0a%3c The other clones have obviously heard the commotion and are on their way %0a%3c towards Norris and Horace....Run!%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Scene 11 - Leroy TV%0a%3c %0a%3c TV Update, maybe demands by the 001 clone etc.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Scene 12 %0a%3c %0a%3c Norris and Horace realise that they can utilise the side effect of the nuclear %0a%3c hoover to short circuit the clone army.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Scene 13 %0a%3c %0a%3c Some scheme to get all the clones in the same place is hatched, and they short %0a%3c circuit all the clones.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Scene 14%0a%3c %0a%3c Norris and Horace congratulating themselves, when we see from clone 001's eyes, %0a%3c it is like the Terminator, all red with computer writing, and we see a shot of %0a%3c 001s eye glowing red as he REROUTES POWER.%0a%3c %0a%3c Clone 001 comes back to life, and there is a bit of a battle maybe, where clone %0a%3c 001 reveals he is actually a common or garden android he has got super powers like %0a%3c a hand that flips open to reveal a laser gun and all that! Or better, he takes a %0a%3c pen out of his lapel pocket that has been there all along, and it gets all big and %0a%3c becomes a double-ended lightsabre!%0a%3c %0a%3c There is a bit of a battle, where Horace eventually almost defeats 001, maybe %0a%3c his baseball bat gets cut in two or something during this, but anyway, 001 has %0a%3c limbs missing and all that, and robo bits hanging out, and realises he cannot win and %0a%3c he grabs the automic hoover, straps it to his back, switches the switch on the %0a%3c side from SUCK to BLOW, and it is a JETPAC! As he hovers away he turns back to %0a%3c Norris and Horace and says "You have not heard the last of me!" before zooming off.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Scene 15 - Leroy TV Epilogue%0a%3c %0a%3c Quick Summary with Leroy, with stills from the events before, and Norris being %0a%3c a hero again (even though it is Horace who saved the day really - Horace is %0a%3c trying to get in shot in the background but Norris is blocking him out). %0a%3c %0a%3c Or maybe we do that as a paper headline review, with Leroy looking through the %0a%3c papers and there will be serious ones, and really stupid ones.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Scene 16 Back to Norris' flat%0a%3c %0a%3c Norris and Horace having a cup of 'Coffea' with a big box of it in front of %0a%3c them, they are having a talk and end on some witty pun.%0a%3c %0a%3c As they are sitting there bits of rubbish start rematerialising around them one by one!%0a%3c %0a%3c Horace: (picking up an old crisp packet that has just materialised on top of his cup of tea) "What's happening?"%0a%3c %0a%3c Norris: "Oh-oh, It looks like Einstein was right, you CAN'T erase things from time, you can only push them forward a bit!"%0a%3c %0a%3c And that's the end with them sitting there and more and more rubbish materialising around them.%0a%3c %0a%3c (Perhaps it turns out that the hoover rubbish from time as he thinks, it is transporting them into the future so they only disappear for a while and then come back.... hmmmm......... and therefore the clones come back for WAM3 even when he thinks he has erased them, and he only realises at the end of WAM2 when he gets back home and finds all the rubbish has reappeared in his flat, and it is left unsaid that this therefore means that the clones are about to reappear.  Maybe.)%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!THE END.%0a%3c %0a---%0a> This page will be updated with information/photos/file downloads for "What A Mess 2" once the film is in post-production.%0a> %0a> Until then, you could always check out our:%0a> %0a> [[Scripts/WhatAMess2outline | Script Outline for What a Mess 2]] %0a> %0a> [[Scripts/WhatAMess2 | Latest Draft Script for What a Mess 2]] %0a> %0a> [[Misc/ScreenTest | Teaser Trailer/Effects Test for What A Mess 2]]%0a> %0a
