Leroy TV begins...%0a> %0a> !!!Scene 2 - Leroy TV%0a> %0a> Couple of humorous stories e.g:%0a> %0a> -------------------------------------%0a> Thousands Lose Jobs As Glasgow Unemployment Offices Close%0a> %0a> In another devastating blow to Glasgow's already fragile economy, the Unemployment Agency of the city %0a> of Glasgow today permanently shuttered nine of it's branch offices, leaving more than 8,500 %0a> unemployment employees unemployed.%0a> %0a> Announcing the closings at a press conference, Glasgow council spokesperson Jennifer Granholm %0a> called them "a tragic coda" to a once-vibrant industry that until this week defined the Glasgow %0a> economy and served almost one-fifth of the city's employable population.%0a> %0a> "This is a sad day for the people of Glasgow," Granholm said to a crowd of part-time reporters %0a> and former assembly-line workers Tuesday. "Our city has a long, hallowed history of unemployment, %0a> and with these closings, we have lost a vital part of our economic and social fabric." %0a> -------------------------------------%0a> %0a> %0a> Then:%0a> %0a> FIVE YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF GIANT RAMPAGE%0a> %0a> Five years ago today the city of Edinburgh was rocked by a unexplained phenomenon, the overnight %0a> appearance of a 50 foot man-like creature, running amok. Only the timely intervention of Professor %0a> Norris Austerberry averted an almost-certain disaster, and city-leaders today commemorated the %0a> bravery shown on that fateful day. %0a> %0a> There is an article about how it is five years to the day since the happenings of the first film, %0a> there is an interview with some experts, and a still of Norris with his hair all combed across, %0a> looking spoddish as ever, with a big medal for bravery. %0a> %0a> !!!Scene 3 - Norris' House%0a> %0a> A letter gets posted through the front door, Norris gets up from the sofa and goes to the door and picks up the letter, he opens it and starts to read it. A narrator (not Norris) reads the contents as we see Norris%0a> reading it.%0a> %0a> Letter says:%0a>  "Dear Professor Austerberry, %0a>  %0a>  Thankyou for your recent application to register as a government-regulated %0a>  user of Plutonium. I am familiar with your previous research, and I am %0a>  pleased to inform you that in light of your current research project requirements,%0a>  your application to store and utilise 1 kilogram of the  Plutonium-239 isotope %0a>  has been provisionally approved.%0a>  %0a>  Due to the precarious nature of this element, and safety concerns on it's use,%0a>  our agreement is  conditional on your work being observed at all times by a %0a>  qualified Government Inspector, who will monitor your methods and techniques,%0a>  to ensure adherence to relevant health and safety legislation. %0a>  %0a>  As we are aware that you have already taken receipt of the Plutonium, a Government %0a>  Inspector has already been assigned to you, and will be with you shortly. %0a>  Your Inspector is named "Horace Noteworthy". %0a>  %0a>  We trust that these requirements will be acceptable to you,%0a>  %0a>  Yours Sincerely,%0a>  %0a>  Roger Mondex"%0a> %0a> %0a> The doorbell rings just as Norris finishes reading the letter, Norris answers it and it is Horace in a suit and with specs on and with a notepad under his arm. He is the image of efficiency.%0a> \\\%0a> Norris: "Hello, you must be from the Government?"\\%0a> Horace: "Yes, Horace Noteworthy, Government Inspector, I take it _you_ (looks Norris up and down distainfully) must be Professor Norris Austerberry?"\\%0a> Norris: "Yes that's me, I suppose you'd better come in"\\\%0a> %0a> Horace comes into the house and they make their way through to the livingroom, which is still full of mess.\\\%0a> %0a> Norris:"Well I suppose you're going to be here for a while, would you like something to drink?"\\%0a> Horace: "Yes, a cup of tea would be nice thanks"\\%0a> Norris: "Tea? You don't want that, you want to try this, my new invention! It has all the benefits of tea AND coffee combined in one handy drink!"\\\%0a> %0a> Norris pours some tea from a flask into a cup, would be good if it was a glass cup.\\\%0a> %0a> Horace looks suspiciously at it.\\\%0a> %0a> Norris: "Try it! It's revolutionary! This is going to change the face of beverages!"\\\%0a> %0a> Horace gingerly takes a sip.\\\%0a> %0a> [Wobbly fade from scene to a dream sequence, which is an 10 second advert for Coftea, all psychadelic etc. finishing with a shot of Norris tasting it and exclaiming "It's great!"]\\\%0a> %0a> Snap back to present, with Horace spitting out the drink violently!\\\%0a> %0a> Horace (annoyed): "Is this just tea AND coffee in the same drink?"\\%0a> Norris (sheepishly): "Erm, yes. Yes it is."\\%0a> pause\\%0a> Norris (aside): "and toothpaste."\\\%0a> %0a> %0a> !!!Scene 4 - an attic door somewhere\\\%0a> %0a> The attic door opens, and slowly a Norris clone climbs out. He looks around a %0a> bit, then whispers up into the attic "It's all clear!" and walks off. Another %0a> Norris clone makes its way down and follows him, followed by another, and %0a> another....\\\%0a> %0a> !!!Scene 5 - A room full of desks and a flipchart.\\\%0a> %0a> There is a Norris clone wearing number 001 on his labcoat in front of the flip %0a> chart, he is explaining a plan. His audience are a whole bunch of Norris clones %0a> with different numbers, they are mostly not paying much attention, one is %0a> picking his nose, one is asleep and snoring, one is scratching himself. Maybe %0a> one is pinging rolled up bits of paper with a ruler at another one - we need to %0a> think how to do that with multiple split screens. One of them (clone 007) is like a James Bond clone, he wears shades and tries to act cooler than the other clones, and when you see him, you hear some 007 like music.\\\%0a> %0a> 001 is telling the other clones about how the original Norris clone managed to %0a> duplicate himself during the night he was on the rampage, and for 5 years the %0a> original duplicate - 001 - has been making further copies, at a rate of 1 every %0a> 24 hours, until today, 5 years to the day that the orginal clone was %0a> horrifically butchered by Norris, they have a CLONE ARMY of almost 2000 clones! %0a> (yeah yeah, with 3 digit numbers they only have enough for 999 clones - that %0a> can be an in-joke) And mission number 1 is to avenge the death of their %0a> creator, by destroying Norris!\\\%0a> %0a> !!!Scene 6 - Norris' House.\\\%0a> %0a> Horace: "This place is in a terrible mess..."\\%0a> Norris: "It's not been the same since Edwina left me..."\\%0a> Norris picks up a photo frame and looks longingly at it (but we do not yet see %0a> the photo)\\%0a> Horace: "I'm sorry, I didn't know..."\\%0a> Norris: "That's okay, it's not your fault, but who could have guessed that Melvin would have run off with my wife?"\\\%0a> %0a> We see the photo he is holding, it is a faked up one of Edwina and Melvin.\\\%0a> %0a> Norris: "God, I miss him" (too obvious joke?)\\%0a> Horace: "You need to keep yourself busy, take your mind off it, you should tidy up this mess for a start!"\\\%0a> %0a> Norris puts down photo.\\\%0a> %0a> Norris: (excitedly) "Yes, I have been working on that! I have made this..." - drags out a super-hoover with a massive big nozzle on the end.\\\%0a> %0a> Norris: "It is my Plutonium-powered vaccum cleaner, the Norisuck 9000! It's a revolutionary new concept in vacuum cleaning! It doesn't just suck up rubbish, it ERASES IT FROM THE FABRIC OF TIME AND SPACE!"\\\%0a> %0a> ||||%0a> Norris doesn't go for the obvious solutions to problems, right? e.g. instead of tidying his flat the obvious way in WAM1 he builds a cloning machine.\\%0a> Well the nuclear hoover doesn't just hoover stuff into a bag because that would have to be emptied, which is inconvenient.\\\%0a> No, it erases things from time!\\\%0a> So crisp bags that are lying on the carpet suddenly have never existed. Of course the technology is new and he is still having some teething%0a> problems with it, like shorting out other electrical equipment. And maybe he can only erase small things. %0a> %0a> If it erases it all from time (so he thinks) we can do a cross-fade shot of rubbish with the same shot with the rubbish removed. Locking the camera position between shots should just make the rubbish all fade away! We could also cut to some close-ups of rubbish fading, and do them with a blue screen - so on the close-up you can see that it doesn't just fade, it sort of shimmers and disappears. On the long shot it would just fade, but that is fine because I only mean like a slight shimmer.%0a> ||||%0a> %0a> Norris and Horace try out the nuclear vacuum and it sucks up all the rubbish, %0a> plus various other bits of furniture, and blows some lightbulbs etc.\\\%0a> %0a> Horace: "Maybe it's a bit too powerful?"\\%0a> Norris: "Well is does seem to knock out any electrical appliances within a 2 %0a> mile radius, but that is just teething problems! A bit more shielding is all %0a> that's required and it will be ready for market!"\\\%0a> %0a> %0a> !!!Scene 7 - The clone army on the march%0a> %0a> Loads of shots of clones and that, %0a> which turns out to be on the news, it is Leroy TV!\\\%0a> %0a> Leroy: "Those are the horrific scenes from just a few moments ago. Details are %0a> still sketchy, but we have here in the studio Chief Inspector Derek %0a> Stumpworthy. \\\%0a> %0a> Chief Inspector, can you shed any light on the current situation?"\\\%0a> %0a> Me in a police uniform...\\\%0a> %0a> !!!Scene 8 - TV switches off, we are back in Norris' flat.\\\%0a> %0a> Norris: Blah blah, explanation, this is all my doing, we have to do something.\\%0a> Horace: Do we still have the normiliser gun from last time?\\\%0a> %0a> They get the old normaliser gun out (or something similar) it is covered in %0a> dust, but still working, as Norris assures Horace. Horace decides to take along a %0a> baseball bat just in case, there are an awful lot of them.\\\%0a> %0a> !!!Scene 9 - Outside\\\%0a> %0a> Norris and Horace set off to meet the clones, they travel on a motorbike, %0a> Horace driving, and Norris on the back.%0a> %0a> !!!Scene 10 - Outside %0a> %0a> They spot some clones in the distance climbing over a fence and off they go %0a> after them.%0a> %0a> By the time they get there, all the clones are gone except the last one who is %0a> struggling over the fence, he has got a bit stuck. %0a> %0a> Norris: "Okay let him have it!"%0a> Horace shoots the normaliser at the clone, but the only effect is to get the %0a> clone attention, it starts making its way towards Norris and Horace in a bit of a %0a> zombie like fashion!%0a> %0a> There is panic as it gets closer and closer, and Norris takes the normiliser to %0a> fiddle with the controls. The clone closes in and grabs Norris by the neck %0a> trying to strangle him!%0a> %0a> There is a brief struggle, and then Horace whacks the clones head off with a %0a> baseball bat!%0a> %0a> There is a shot of a disembodied head and body lying on the grass, they are %0a> still moving in a mechanical manner and there are all wires and that, plus mechanical %0a> grinding noises!%0a> %0a> Norris: "Whew! Thanks Horace!"%0a> Horace: "I told you the normaliser wouldn't work after all this time"%0a> Norris: "I think I know why it didn't work, these aren't proper clones, they %0a> are robotic androids!"%0a> %0a> Norris bends over the body of the still moving andriod, its hands are like all %0a> fumbling and grasping, he opens up the labcoat and shirt, and there are all %0a> electronic lights and that inside!%0a> %0a> Horace: "Robots?"%0a> Norris (dismissively): "Yes, the original clone did not have the time to make a %0a> proper cloning machine, he obviously made a cybernetic duplication device, an %0a> altogether much simpler contraption..."%0a> %0a> Blah blah we have to think up another plan...%0a> %0a> We have to think of one quite quick - look!%0a> %0a> The other clones have obviously heard the commotion and are on their way %0a> towards Norris and Horace....Run!%0a> %0a> !!!Scene 11 - Leroy TV%0a> %0a> TV Update, maybe demands by the 001 clone etc.%0a> %0a> !!!Scene 12 %0a> %0a> Norris and Horace realise that they can utilise the side effect of the nuclear %0a> hoover to short circuit the clone army.%0a> %0a> !!!Scene 13 %0a> %0a> Some scheme to get all the clones in the same place is hatched, and they short %0a> circuit all the clones.%0a> %0a> !!!Scene 14%0a> %0a> Norris and Horace congratulating themselves, when we see from clone 001's eyes, %0a> it is like the Terminator, all red with computer writing, and we see a shot of %0a> 001s eye glowing red as he REROUTES POWER.%0a> %0a> Clone 001 comes back to life, and there is a bit of a battle maybe, where clone %0a> 001 reveals he is actually a common or garden android he has got super powers like %0a> a hand that flips open to reveal a laser gun and all that! Or better, he takes a %0a> pen out of his lapel pocket that has been there all along, and it gets all big and %0a> becomes a double-ended lightsabre!%0a> %0a> There is a bit of a battle, where Horace eventually almost defeats 001, maybe %0a> his baseball bat gets cut in two or something during this, but anyway, 001 has %0a> limbs missing and all that, and robo bits hanging out, and realises he cannot win and %0a> he grabs the automic hoover, straps it to his back, switches the switch on the %0a> side from SUCK to BLOW, and it is a JETPAC! As he hovers away he turns back to %0a> Norris and Horace and says "You have not heard the last of me!" before zooming off.%0a> %0a> !!!Scene 15 - Leroy TV Epilogue%0a> %0a> Quick Summary with Leroy, with stills from the events before, and Norris being %0a> a hero again (even though it is Horace who saved the day really - Horace is %0a> trying to get in shot in the background but Norris is blocking him out). %0a> %0a> Or maybe we do that as a paper headline review, with Leroy looking through the %0a> papers and there will be serious ones, and really stupid ones.%0a> %0a> !!!Scene 16 Back to Norris' flat%0a> %0a> Norris and Horace having a cup of 'Coffea' with a big box of it in front of %0a> them, they are having a talk and end on some witty pun.%0a> %0a> As they are sitting there bits of rubbish start rematerialising around them one by one!%0a> %0a> Horace: (picking up an old crisp packet that has just materialised on top of his cup of tea) "What's happening?"%0a> %0a> Norris: "Oh-oh, It looks like Einstein was right, you CAN'T erase things from time, you can only push them forward a bit!"%0a> %0a> And that's the end with them sitting there and more and more rubbish materialising around them.%0a> %0a> (Perhaps it turns out that the hoover rubbish from time as he thinks, it is transporting them into the future so they only disappear for a while and then come back.... hmmmm......... and therefore the clones come back for WAM3 even when he thinks he has erased them, and he only realises at the end of WAM2 when he gets back home and finds all the rubbish has reappeared in his flat, and it is left unsaid that this therefore means that the clones are about to reappear.
