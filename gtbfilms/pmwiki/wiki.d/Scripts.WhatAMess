The camera pans up to the sofa, and you see a pair of stupid/fluffy slippers, it pans up the person wearing them slippers, and they are covered in wrapper and that too, eventually you get to the persons face, and it is this baldy boy, with specs, and mad bushy grey hair at the sides. He has a HUGE bag of crisps (one of them multipack bags) and is stuffing them into his mouth, dropping crumbs all over the shop, no looking at what he is doing, because he is obviously watching the telly intently.%0a%0aThe credits/title will be superimposed over the above sequence.%0a%0aScene 1 The Livingroom%0a%0aCut to a medium shot, and the door to the livingroom opens, it is the scientists wife (Edwina Austerberry). She is obviously going out, as she is putting on her coat. %0a%0aWife: "I'm going out shopping"%0aBloke: (no paying attention) "Uh-huh"%0aWife: "What a Mess this place is, make sure you get it tidied up before I get back, or there will be hell to pay"%0aBloke: "Uh-huh".%0aWife: "My mother always said you were a lazy good for nothing, GET THIS PLACE TIDIED UP BEFORE I GET A DIVORCE!"%0a%0aWife leaves, slamming the door.%0a%0aBloke looks at slammed door incredulously, looks around the room, "Doesn't look too bad to me.", opens another beer.%0a%0aSwitch to view from behind him, so we can see the telly he is watching. There is a news story on, zoom into TV so it takes up the whole screen:%0a%0aNews:%0aNewsReader: "Claims from a religious sect that it has cloned the first human have been greeted with a mixture of astonishment, revulsion and deep scepticism.  The Raelian movement is the founder of the Clonaid company which today claimed to have cloned a human being. L.ROY TV interviewed cult spokesman Thaddeus Holzmeister earlier today....%0aDead weird looking religious cult boy: "Recent advances in technology have allowed our scientists here at Clonaid to replicate an individual perfectly. The resulting clones are identical to the original in every way" %0a%0aNewsReader: "Scientists and governments worldwide have universally condemmed the work of Clonaid, claiming that the technology to clone a human is still unpredicatable and not fully understood."%0a%0aSwitch back to boy on sofa, he is scritching his chin and thinking up an idea, slowly he begins to smile.%0a%0aNewsReader (on telly in background) "In other news, popstar Michael Jackson has had his nose replaced by a carrot. The popstar, who denies having cosmetic surgery, claims that the apparent replacement of his nose with a root vegetable is the result of a rare, and previously unknown medical condition. Critics claim that whacko-jacko, as he is known, has gone too far, in his quest to emulate his hero, Frosty the snowman".%0a%0aBoy on sofa: "Eureka! I have got it!"%0a%0aLeaves living room.%0a%0aScene 2 Hallway%0a%0aLazy Scientist Boy (Norris Austerberry) is on the phone, when he dials the number, we switch to split screen, like they used to do in Trumpton. So you see another phone somplace else ringing. His assistant (Melvin Beaker) picks it up.%0a%0aAssistant: "Hello?"%0aScientist: "Melvin?"%0aAssistant: "Yes"%0aScientist: "It's me, Norris, Edwina is threatening to leave me if I don't tidy up this mess, but I've had a great idea, and I need your help!"%0aAssistant: "I'll be right round!"%0a%0aScene 3 Hallway%0a%0aA-Team like build sequence, of the two boys hammering and putting together a machine. Lots of cables and that, and the assistant guy carrying them about, and the scientist guy (who is now wearing a labcoat) point things oot to him and that.%0a%0aScene 4 Hallway%0a%0aMachine constructed, and there are wires from it leading to a cupboard. There are also wires coming from it leading to a chair, with a sort of headband/hat thing on it. Maybe even a motorbike helmet, with silver foil and that on it. The machine itself is a large silver box, with circuit boards on it, and a PC screen seemingly attached, in addition, there is a large glass bulb on the top, but it is not doing anything. There is a stupidly large lever, which obviously acts as the CLONE NOW button.%0a%0aThe two boys are standing there admiring their handywork. %0a%0aNorris: "It's ready! Our very own CLONING MACHINE!"%0aMelvin: (doubtful) "Do you think it will work?"%0aNorris: "Of course it will work! With this, I can create a clone of myself, and get him to do all my work for me, he can tidy up the house, wash the dishes, everything!"%0aMelvin: (doubtful) "Maybe we should test it first"%0aNorris: "Hmmm. Maybe you're right, we don't want to take any chances. What I need is a test subject to clone first, just incase something goes wrong"%0aMelvin: (worried) "Not a person, maybe just something like, erm, this apple" (grabs apple from table it has been sitting on)%0aNorris: (disappointed): "Hmm, yes, I suppose. That apple will have to do"%0a%0aSo they place the apple on the chair, and put the helmet on top of it.%0a%0aThey both put goggles on, and Norris stands well back. %0a%0aNorris: "Ok Melvin, ACTIVATE!"%0a%0aMelvin, looking scared, pulls the lever, as he does so, we get a closeup of him closing his eyes tight, incase of an explosion. The lights all dim and flicker, and the bulb on top of the machine comes alive with all lightning and that in it. There is a huge hum of power, and crackling. The PC screen displays a program that is full screen and displays "CLONING..... PLEASE WAIT" there is a gauge moving up to 100%25 and a strand of DNA revolving, at the side is a readout of DNA code scrolling past, all base pair triplets like ATG-CCG-TGA-GGG-CTA-AGT- etc etc.%0a%0aWe get a close up of that pc screen as it gets up to 100%25, then there is a microwave BING! and the program says "CLONING SUCCESSFUL!".%0a%0aSwitch back to medium shot, the lights are back to normal, and the bulb is no longer active. They open the cupboard and it is blue screened inside. There will be like a moving colour plasma effect in there. Infront of that effect, is a chair, and on that chair is an apple.%0a%0aNorris picks the apple up%0a%0aNorris:  "Perfect! It is an identical clone of the original!"%0aMelvin: "How do you know it is perfect?"%0aNorris: "Of course it is perfect! LOOK, it is an exact clone! Right! Let's not waste any more time, I have a flat to tidy!"%0a%0aSo they close the cupboard, and Norris sits himself down on the chair, and puts on the helmet.%0a%0aMelvin: "Don't you think we'd better....."%0aNorris: "Come on, come on, pull the lever!"%0a%0aSo we get the same sequence as before, and when that is finished,  Melvin goes to the cupboard door as Norris takes off the helmet. We switch to a wider angle (split screen) as Melvin opens the door, and sitting there is an exact clone of Norris!%0a%0aNorris: (taking off helmet) "Wow, that was intense!"%0aNorrisclone: "You're telling me."%0a%0aMelvin looks from the Norrisclone to Norris, and back again, then keels over backwards in a dead faint. (Lucky I kept that spare mattress eh?).%0a%0aScene 5 Livingroom%0a%0aNorris is sitting with his feet up on the sofa, waching the telly again, and eating crisps, while the clone is tidying up around him.%0a%0aNorris: "...and make sure you make a good job of that tidying, I want this place spotless. And when you have finished in here, there is a huge pile of dishes in the kitchen that are needing washed, and then all the windows need cleaned..."%0a%0aClone continues to tidy.%0a%0aNorris: "I am going to bed now, make sure you have all that stuff done by the morning"%0a%0aNorris leaves.%0a%0aScene 6 The kitchen%0a%0aTime passes transition, to the clone in the kitchen, washing dishes, he drys off a plate, and starts to put it away in the cupboard, he opens the cupboard and a big bag of crisps catches his eye, he takes it, and reaches in inquisitively, before tasting a crisp gingerly. He smiles, and starts to eat crisps by the handful. %0a%0aFade to black.%0a%0aScene 7 The next morning.%0a%0aNorris gets out of bed, scratches his head and says aloud "I hope that clone has finished tidying up, just looking at him makes me tired."%0a%0aHe gets up, and looks for the clone.%0a%0aNorris: "Hey Norrisclone! WHere are you? My car is needing washed today, and the groceries need bought!"%0a%0aNorris walks through to the livingroom, and picks up the original apple. He takes a bit out of it, and makes his way to the kitchen, the bite of apple drops out his mouth when he walks into the kitchen and there, on the table, is a HUGE clone apple!%0a%0aNorris: "Oh-oh. I have got a really bad feeling about this"%0a%0aNorris runs though to the bedroom, the curtains are still drawn, he places a hand on each curtain, and pulls them open quickly. There, looking in the window, is the face of the huge clone.%0a%0aCut to side shot of Norris still opening the curtains, and he goes "Aaaaaaaaargh!".%0a%0aBack to a shot from behind Norris, he quickly shuts the curtains, and turns to face the camera, composing himself for a second, he turns back and opens the curtains again gingerly, there is nothing there anymore.%0a%0aNorris picks up a nearby phone, and calls his assistant, Melvin.%0a%0aNorris: "Melvin? Yesterdays experiment has gone badly wrong, I need you round here right now!"%0a%0aScene 8 Hallway.%0a%0aKnock at door%0a%0aNorris answers it in a panic.%0a%0aNorris: "Thank Goodness you're here, the Norrisclone has grown to gigantic proportions and it running amok around town!"%0aMelvin: "Oh man, don't exaggerate!"%0aNorris: "I'm serious, come and look at this..."%0a%0aNorris leads into the livingroom, and switches on the TV.%0a%0aTV Newsflash%0a%0aNewsreader: "The city has been thrown into panic today, by sightings of a giant creature, of unknown origin, running amok in the streets of Edinburgh. Eye witnesses reported seeing a 30 foot man-like creature on the rampage at various locations and...(presses ear)....yes, I think we have a LIVE linkup to our reporter on the scene, Brian Spock.%0a%0aSwitch to Brian Spock on the scene holding a microphone.%0a%0aBrian: "Thankyou Leroy, I am here at the epicentre of the sightings, and although we've not seen anything yet, hysteria is building as the rumours spread. In some areas, looting and rioting have broken out, as people panic, some predicting the end of the world is nigh, and,  we're going to have to move, the police are moving us on here, I'm not sure whats happening, but we are being told to clear the area..."%0a%0aBig clone in the background of the above shot.%0a%0aBack to studio:%0a%0aNewsreader: "Thanks Brian, and we'll stay with that story and keep you informed of any developments. In other news...."%0a%0aClick! Norris switches off the TV.%0a%0aNorris: "See? My clone is running amok! We have to DO something!"%0aMelvin: "You're right, but what can WE do against something that size?"%0aNorris: "I have a plan, but I need your help."%0a%0aScene 9%0a%0aA-Team like building sequence again.%0a%0aScene 10 Hallway%0a%0aMelvin is now wearing a large silver box strapped to his back, and is holding a gun like object that is wired up to the box.%0a%0aHe has got on a pair of goggles.%0a%0aMelvin: "So are you sure this is going to work?"%0aNorris: "Of course I'm sure, you simply shoot the Normalizer gun at a target, and it will return it to it's normal size!"%0aMelvin: "Don't you think we should test it first?"%0aNorris: "Well, if you like, the big cloned apple is in the kitchen, you can test it out on that if you like"%0a%0aMelvin nods, and goes into the kitchen.%0a%0aThere is a BANG! and Melvin emerges from the kitchen, he is covered in bits of apple!%0a%0aNorris: "Well?"%0aMelvin: "I think it still needs some work."%0aNorris (tastes some apple): "Hmmm, not bad apple sauce"%0aMelvin: "Not good either, I don't want covered in body parts, we need to fix the machine"%0aNorris:  "We don't have time for that, just turn down the power a bit and it will probably be okay"%0aMelvin (doubtful): "And the clone won't go the same way as the apple?"%0aNorris: "No, it will be fine."%0aMelvin seems to swallow this and goes out the door.%0aNorris: "Probably."%0a%0aFade to black%0a%0aScene 11 Outside in the meadows or that.%0a%0aWe have the two heros wandering around, and then the clone comes round the side of a building, they see it, pause for a second, realising how big it is, and then turn around and run for it, past the camera. The clone will be all like roaring and that by this stage.%0a%0aThe heros are running away and we get a nice shot where there is plenty of room to add the clone in.%0a%0aNorris: "Use the normalizer, use the normalizer!"%0aMelvin: "But... But what if...."%0aNorris: "Use it!"%0a%0aLongish shot of Melvin firing the normalizer gun at an advancing clone, loads of clone shouting "Aaaaargh" as the beam from the normalizer hits him and he shrinks and shrinks.%0a%0aNorris (cutaway): "It's working, its working!"%0a%0aClone continues to shrink and we get closeups of Melvin and Norris to hide the fact we are taking another angle for the clone, to allow him to get really tiny.%0a%0aClone goes down to about 2 inches in height, close up of ground, and we get someones foot stepping on him.%0a%0aCut to person (Edwina) who has just stepped on something, they look at the sole of their shoe, and there is like white and red plasticine stuck to it. They tut tut to themselves, and say "What a Mess" with Norris and Melvin standing in the background open mouthed.%0a%0aTHE END.%0a%0a%0a%0a

(Lucky I kept that spare mattress eh?).%0a%3c %0a%3c Scene 5 Livingroom%0a%3c %0a%3c Norris is sitting with his feet up on the sofa, waching the telly again, and eating crisps, while the clone is tidying up around him.%0a%3c %0a%3c Norris: "...and make sure you make a good job of that tidying, I want this place spotless. And when you have finished in here, there is a huge pile of dishes in the kitchen that are needing washed, and then all the windows need cleaned..."%0a%3c %0a%3c Clone continues to tidy.%0a%3c %0a%3c Norris: "I am going to bed now, make sure you have all that stuff done by the morning"%0a%3c %0a%3c Norris leaves.%0a%3c %0a%3c Scene 6 The kitchen%0a%3c %0a%3c Time passes transition, to the clone in the kitchen, washing dishes, he drys off a plate, and starts to put it away in the cupboard, he opens the cupboard and a big bag of crisps catches his eye, he takes it, and reaches in inquisitively, before tasting a crisp gingerly. He smiles, and starts to eat crisps by the handful. %0a%3c %0a%3c Fade to black.%0a%3c %0a%3c Scene 7 The next morning.%0a%3c %0a%3c Norris gets out of bed, scratches his head and says aloud "I hope that clone has finished tidying up, just looking at him makes me tired."%0a%3c %0a%3c He gets up, and looks for the clone.%0a%3c %0a%3c Norris: "Hey Norrisclone! WHere are you? My car is needing washed today, and the groceries need bought!"%0a%3c %0a%3c Norris walks through to the livingroom, and picks up the original apple. He takes a bit out of it, and makes his way to the kitchen, the bite of apple drops out his mouth when he walks into the kitchen and there, on the table, is a HUGE clone apple!%0a%3c %0a%3c Norris: "Oh-oh. I have got a really bad feeling about this"%0a%3c %0a%3c Norris runs though to the bedroom, the curtains are still drawn, he places a hand on each curtain, and pulls them open quickly. There, looking in the window, is the face of the huge clone.%0a%3c %0a%3c Cut to side shot of Norris still opening the curtains, and he goes "Aaaaaaaaargh!".%0a%3c %0a%3c Back to a shot from behind Norris, he quickly shuts the curtains, and turns to face the camera, composing himself for a second, he turns back and opens the curtains again gingerly, there is nothing there anymore.%0a%3c %0a%3c Norris picks up a nearby phone, and calls his assistant, Melvin.%0a%3c %0a%3c Norris: "Melvin? Yesterdays experiment has gone badly wrong, I need you round here right now!"%0a%3c %0a%3c Scene 8 Hallway.%0a%3c %0a%3c Knock at door%0a%3c %0a%3c Norris answers it in a panic.%0a%3c %0a%3c Norris: "Thank Goodness you're here, the Norrisclone has grown to gigantic proportions and it running amok around town!"%0a%3c Melvin: "Oh man, don't exaggerate!"%0a%3c Norris: "I'm serious, come and look at this..."%0a%3c %0a%3c Norris leads into the livingroom, and switches on the TV.%0a%3c %0a%3c TV Newsflash%0a%3c %0a%3c Newsreader: "The city has been thrown into panic today, by sightings of a giant creature, of unknown origin, running amok in the streets of Edinburgh. Eye witnesses reported seeing a 30 foot man-like creature on the rampage at various locations and...(presses ear)....yes, I think we have a LIVE linkup to our reporter on the scene, Brian Spock.%0a%3c %0a%3c Switch to Brian Spock on the scene holding a microphone.%0a%3c %0a%3c Brian: "Thankyou Leroy, I am here at the epicentre of the sightings, and although we've not seen anything yet, hysteria is building as the rumours spread. In some areas, looting and rioting have broken out, as people panic, some predicting the end of the world is nigh, and,  we're going to have to move, the police are moving us on here, I'm not sure whats happening, but we are being told to clear the area..."%0a%3c %0a%3c Big clone in the background of the above shot.%0a%3c %0a%3c Back to studio:%0a%3c %0a%3c Newsreader: "Thanks Brian, and we'll stay with that story and keep you informed of any developments. In other news...."%0a%3c %0a%3c Click! Norris switches off the TV.%0a%3c %0a%3c Norris: "See? My clone is running amok! We have to DO something!"%0a%3c Melvin: "You're right, but what can WE do against something that size?"%0a%3c Norris: "I have a plan, but I need your help."%0a%3c %0a%3c Scene 9%0a%3c %0a%3c A-Team like building sequence again.%0a%3c %0a%3c Scene 10 Hallway%0a%3c %0a%3c Melvin is now wearing a large silver box strapped to his back, and is holding a gun like object that is wired up to the box.%0a%3c %0a%3c He has got on a pair of goggles.%0a%3c %0a%3c Melvin: "So are you sure this is going to work?"%0a%3c Norris: "Of course I'm sure, you simply shoot the Normalizer gun at a target, and it will return it to it's normal size!"%0a%3c Melvin: "Don't you think we should test it first?"%0a%3c Norris: "Well, if you like, the big cloned apple is in the kitchen, you can test it out on that if you like"%0a%3c %0a%3c Melvin nods, and goes into the kitchen.%0a%3c %0a%3c There is a BANG! and Melvin emerges from the kitchen, he is covered in bits of apple!%0a%3c %0a%3c Norris: "Well?"%0a%3c Melvin: "I think it still needs some work."%0a%3c Norris (tastes some apple): "Hmmm, not bad apple sauce"%0a%3c Melvin: "Not good either, I don't want covered in body parts, we need to fix the machine"%0a%3c Norris:  "We don't have time for that, just turn down the power a bit and it will probably be okay"%0a%3c Melvin (doubtful): "And the clone won't go the same way as the apple?"%0a%3c Norris: "No, it will be fine."%0a%3c Melvin seems to swallow this and goes out the door.%0a%3c Norris: "Probably."%0a%3c %0a%3c Fade to black%0a%3c %0a%3c Scene 11 Outside in the meadows or that.%0a%3c %0a%3c We have the two heros wandering around, and then the clone comes round the side of a building, they see it, pause for a second, realising how big it is, and then turn around and run for it, past the camera. The clone will be all like roaring and that by this stage.%0a%3c %0a%3c The heros are running away and we get a nice shot where there is plenty of room to add the clone in.%0a%3c %0a%3c Norris: "Use the normalizer, use the normalizer!"%0a%3c Melvin: "But... But what if...."%0a%3c Norris: "Use it!"%0a%3c %0a%3c Longish shot of Melvin firing the normalizer gun at an advancing clone, loads of clone shouting "Aaaaargh" as the beam from the normalizer hits him and he shrinks and shrinks.%0a%3c %0a%3c Norris (cutaway): "It's working, its working!"%0a%3c %0a%3c Clone continues to shrink and we get closeups of Melvin and Norris to hide the fact we are taking another angle for the clone, to allow him to get really tiny.%0a%3c %0a%3c Clone goes down to about 2 inches in height, close up of ground, and we get someones foot stepping on him.%0a%3c %0a%3c Cut to person (Edwina) who has just stepped on something, they look at the sole of their shoe, and there is like white and red plasticine stuck to it. They tut tut to themselves, and say "What a Mess" with Norris and Melvin standing in the background open mouthed.%0a%3c %0a%3c THE END.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a
