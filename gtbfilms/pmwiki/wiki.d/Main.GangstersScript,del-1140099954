The picture on the screen is black and white, and low quality. We also see the back of somebody dressed like a security guard who is eating a doughnut. He is clearly more interested in what is displayed on another screen (maybe football). We don’t see the guard’s face (so that any of us can play this role).%0a%0aShot 3 – We zoom in to the security monitor to make it full screen, and the picture goes bzzzt! and we get colour and sound. Then we can start changing the view and zoom in on important action or expressions (i.e. we are now in the scene).%0a%0a%0aThree gangsters enter the scene - Mr Small and Mr Bump on one side, Mr Tickle on the other.%0aEach side has a case, which they swap.%0aThey look inside. Mr Small and Mr Bump now have a case full of drugs. We see the contents.%0aMr Tickle looks into his case, but we don't see inside (only he does). There is no particular reaction from him.%0aMr Small tastes the drugs (opens them with a knife or flick-comb) while Mr Bump stands guard.%0aThere is a noise in the shadows. Mr Bump and Mr Tickle draw their guns.%0a%0aMr Bump goes to have a look in the shadows, but soon comes back. It was nothing.%0aMr Small nods that the drugs are genuine, and closes his case.%0aMr Tickle puts his gun away but Mr Bump keeps his out and turns it on Mr Small!%0aMr Small looks shocked and starts backing away from Mr Bump.%0a%0aMr Small: “What on Earth…?”%0aMr Bump: "Just a little fund-raising. Don’t take it personally."%0a%0aThe screen goes black and we hear three shots in quick succession and a man falling over.%0aFilm titles (rather than at the start)%0a%0a[[#Scene2]]%0a!!!Scene 2: Stephen’s house%0a%0aStephen at home with his case readying himself for work, making sandwiches etc. All done in a kung fu / Matrix style.%0a%0a[[#Scene3]]%0a!!!Scene 3: Mr Happy’s private office%0a%0aMr Small and Mr Bump are meeting their boss (Mr Happy) and being given a case full of money. This comes before the scene we have seen, a la Pulp Fiction.%0a%0aMr Happy: “Come in. Have a seat.”%0a%0aMr Bump and Mr Small sit down.%0a%0aMr Happy: “Now, first things first. On this job we’ll be using aliases. Under no circumstances are you to tell one another your real name or anything else about yourself. This way the only one who knows who the members of the team are is myself. And that's the way I like it. Because in the unlikely event of one of you getting apprehended by the cops - not that I expect that to happen - you don't have anything to deal with. You don't know any names.”%0a%0aMr Bump / Mr Small: “Okay.”%0a%0aMr Happy: “Right. You’ll be Mr Bump, and you are Mr Small.” (He points to the men as he gives them names).%0a%0aMr Small doesn’t react to this, as he already knows his name. Mr Bump seems quite pleased.%0a%0aMr Happy: “Any questions?”%0a%0aMr Bump / Mr Small: “No.”%0a%0aMr Happy: “Okay, here it is.”%0a%0aMr Happy gives them the case. They open it and see the money inside (so do we).%0a%0aMr Happy: “Okay lads, good luck with the hand-over. Be careful.”%0a%0aAll three rise, and Mr Bump and Mr Small leave.%0a%0a[[#Scene4]]%0a!!!Scene 4: On the train%0a%0aStephen gets on the train to go to work, and puts his case in the luggage rack.%0a%0aAnother man gets on and puts his coat over Stephen's case. He prolly has a briefcase too, but it is a different style.%0a%0aMr Small and Mr Bump get on with their case, and put it in the luggage rack.%0a%0aWe maybe see some footage of the outside of the train speeding along, to indicate that time is passing.%0a%0aThe train gets to a station, and Stephen gets off with the wrong case.%0a%0aThe man picks up his coat and gets off (he is just behind Stephen and leaves at the same station).%0a%0aMr Small and Mr Bump get off at the next stop with Stephen's case. (Actually, maybe it isn’t necessary to show this, as the viewer will assume that they do this.)%0a%0a[[#Scene5]]%0a!!!Scene 5: Mr Happy’s private office%0a%0aA scene with Mr Happy, Mr Small and Mr Tickle. Yes, Mr Tickle. This comes before any of the others (but that isn't obvious).%0a%0aMr Happy and Mr Tickle are seated in Mr Happy’s office. There is a knock at the door.%0a%0aMr Happy: “Come in.”%0a%0aMr Small enters.%0a%0aMr Small: “You wanted me?”%0a%0aMr Happy: “Yes. Have a seat.”%0a%0aMr Small sits down.%0a%0aMr Happy (to Mr Small): "I’d like you to meet my cousin, who runs our operation down in London.”\\%0aMr Tickle and Mr Small acknowledge each other.%0a%0aMr Happy: "Now gentlemen, let me get straight to the point. We have somebody in our organisation who is working for the other side."%0a%0aMr Small looks uncomfortable. Mr Tickle seems to have heard this already, and is just looking at Mr Small.%0a%0aMr Small: "Hold on… you don't… you don't think it's ME, do you?!"%0a%0aMr Happy: "No no, I trust you absolutely. No, it's one of our newer people. I don't know who, but the two of you are going to find out for me."%0a%0aMr Small: "Of course! How?"%0a%0aMr Happy: "I’ll come to that in a moment, but first, I don’t want anybody using their real names on this job. Not once there are other people involved. We’ll be using code names. My cousin here will be known as Mr Tickle and you” (looks at Mr Small) “will be Mr Small”.%0a%0aMr Small: “Why am I Mr Small?”%0a%0aMr Happy: “Because you have a small …” (pause) “…IQ.”%0a%0aMr Small: “Why can't we pick out our own names?”%0a%0aMr Happy: “I tried that once, and it doesn’t work. You get everybody fighting over who's gonna be Mr. Strong. Forget it. I pick. Be thankful you're not Mr. Greedy.”%0a%0aMr Small: “Yeah, but Mr. Small sounds like Mr. Inferior. Tell you what, let me be Mr. Impossible. That sounds good to me, I'm Mr. Impossible.”%0a%0aMr Happy: “You're not Mr. Impossible, somebody from another job is Mr. Impossible. You're Mr. Small.”%0a%0aMr Tickle: “Who cares what your name is? Who cares if you're Mr. Small, Mr. Inferior, Mr. Whatever?”%0a%0aMr Small: “Oh that's really easy for you to say, you're Mr. Tickle. You got a cool-sounding name. So, Mr. Tickle, if you think "Mr. Small" is no big deal, let’s trade.”%0a%0aMr Happy: “No trading! Look, this is not a democracy! Listen up Mr. Small. We got two ways here, my way or the highway. And you can go down either of them. So what'll it be, Mr. Small?”%0a%0aMr Small: “Okay, forget it. This is beneath me. I'm Mr. Small, let's move on.”%0a%0aMr Tickle (to Mr Happy): “And what should we call you?”%0a%0aMr Happy (in a grumpy way): “Just call me Mr Happy”.%0a%0a(Scene fades out)%0a%0a[[#Scene6]]%0a!!!Scene 6: Under Potterrow again%0a%0aNow a flashback to the first scene we saw, but it plays out slightly differently.%0a%0aMr Small: “What on Earth…?”%0aMr Bump: "Just a little fund-raising. Don’t take it personally."%0a%0aThis time the screen doesn't go black.%0a%0aWe see that Mr Tickle has his gun out. He shoots three times in quick succession and Mr Bump falls over.%0a%0aMr Small looks shocked and is breathing hard.%0a%0aMr Small: "Oh wow… thanks… well done… good shot."%0a%0aMr Tickle: "You're welcome. Have some talcum powder to calm your nerves." (He points at the case full of "drugs")%0a%0aMr Small smiles but is still calming down.%0a%0aMr Tickle: "One thing though, I thought we were going to put money in the other case? What if he had opened it up and seen all that stuff?"%0a%0aMr Small: "What stuff? It is full of money!"%0a%0aMr Tickle: "No it isn't!"%0a%0aMr Tickle opens the other case and turns it around to reveal dusters and other cleaning products.%0aMr Small looks as shocked as he possibly can (some good acting required).%0a%0aMr Small: "Oh no!!!"%0a%0aMr Tickle: "Oh no indeed. What are we going to do now?"%0a%0a[[#Scene7]]%0a!!!Scene 7: In the open somewhere%0a%0aStephen approaches a door with his case, ready to sell something.%0a%0aHe rings the bell. A woman comes to the door.%0a%0aWoman: “Hello?”%0a%0aStephen: “Hi there, I’m from Auld Reeky Cleaning Products, and I wonder if I could interest you in some of the items we have for sale? Very cheap, top quality stuff.”%0a%0aWoman: “Oh, I don’t know… I don’t really need anything…”%0a%0aStephen: “Please, let me show you what we have…”%0a%0aHe opens his case and is about to turn it around to show her the contents, but he stops dead in his tracks when he looks into it. We then see his view inside the case. It is full of money.%0a%0aStephen: "Oh no…oh no!”%0a%0aHe looks up at the woman.%0a%0aStephen: “Erm… I’ll get back to you later Mrs… erm… I… erm… forgot to bring the right things with me… erm…sorry…”%0a%0aHe backs away from the door, closes the case, and walks off in a bit of a panic.%0a%0a[[#Scene8]]%0a!!!Scene 8: Under Potterrow 3%0a%0aBack to Mr Tickle and Mr Small again. Mr Bump is lying dead on the ground.%0a%0aMr Small: "Please, you have to believe me! I wouldn't steal from the firm! We've just established that it was him!”%0a(He points to the dead guy on the ground). %0a%0aMr Small: “I don't know what happened to the money."%0a%0aMr Tickle: "I do believe you, mainly because my cousin has such trust in you that he gave you this assignment."%0a%0aMr Small: "So what do we do?"%0a%0aMr Tickle: "What do YOU do, you mean. You're the one who lost it."%0a%0aMr Small: "What?!"%0a%0aMr Tickle: "Okay, I'll help. It doesn't look good if I'm involved in something like this going wrong."%0a%0aMr Small: "Gee, thanks…" (sarcastically)%0a%0aMr Tickle: "Right, let's re-trace your steps from earlier today. Did you put the money in the case?"%0a%0aMr Small: "No, the boss did, but I saw it."%0a%0aMr Tickle: "And since then, has the case been out of your sight at all?"%0a%0aMr Small: "No, I don't think so."%0a%0aMr Tickle: "Think! Did you put it down at any point?"%0a%0aMr Small: "On the train yes, I put it in the luggage rack. There wasn't room for it by my legs." (We see a flashback of this during the chat)%0a%0aMr Tickle: "Any other times?"%0a%0aMr Small: "No."%0a%0aMr Tickle: "Right, come with me."%0a%0aThey set off.%0a%0a[[#Scene9]]%0a!!!Scene 9: Near a bridge over a river%0a%0aStephen is panicking.%0a%0aStephen: "What am I going to do?!!"%0a%0aHe looks around.%0a%0aStephen (thinks): Right… (We hear his thoughts)%0a%0aHe is about to throw the case off the bridge into the river, but stops himself.%0a%0aStephen (thinks): Hold on… what if somebody comes looking for it?%0a%0aHe has another look inside the case.%0a%0aStephen (thinks): Maybe I’ll just keep it safe at home for a while, until I decide what to do.%0aHe walks off (perhaps following a sign to the station).%0a%0a[[#Scene10]]%0a!!!Scene 10: In a moving car / Then at the station%0a%0aMr Tickle is driving and Mr Small is in the passenger seat.%0a%0aMr Small: “Where are we going?”%0a%0aMr Tickle: “Back to the station. We need to follow up who took that case.”%0a%0aMr Small: "I don't remember who was near us on the train."%0a%0aMr Tickle: “We’ll ask a few questions. Maybe talk to the guy at the left luggage office, and see if it’s there for safe keeping. If it is, I’m sure we could persuade him to hand it over to us.” (He pats his jacket where he keeps his gun, and smiles). “In the mean time, keep your eyes peeled.”%0a%0aThey drive on for a bit, with Mr Small looking around at people on the street.%0a%0aMr Small points out of the window at a building they are passing.%0a%0aMr Small: “There’s the casino.”%0a%0aMr Tickle: "You been there?”%0a%0aMr Small: “Yeah. Really top women. I lost a fair bit of cash though.”%0a%0aMr Tickle: “On the gambling or the women?”%0a%0aMr Small: “A bit of both. Oh yeah, and I met this bloke who was telling me about a great roulette strategy. It’s incredible. You can’t lose.”%0a%0aMr Tickle: (sceptically) “Oh yeah? Now this I have to hear!”%0a%0aMr Small: “What you do, right, is you put a quid on black, okay?”%0a%0aMr Tickle: “Okay.”%0a%0aMr Small: “And if that comes up then fine, you win, and you keep doing that. But if red comes up…”%0aMr Tickle (interrupting): “Which tends to happen sometimes…”%0a%0aMr Small: “Yes, it does, so you lose that pound, and next time you put two pounds on black. If that comes up then you win and you go back to one pound on black, but if it’s red again you go up to four pounds.”%0a%0aMr Tickle: “And you keep increasing your stake like this?”%0a%0aMr Small: “Only until you win. Then you go back to a quid.”%0a%0a(At this point they arrive at the station, park and get out of the car. The camera view changes, but the conversation carries on, uninterrupted.)%0a%0aMr Tickle: “So, let me see… if you lose the four quid bet you’re now seven quid down overall, so you bet eight in the hope of winning eight to make you one quid up?”%0a%0aMr Small: “Exactly! Brilliant eh? So you never actually lose anything!”%0a%0aMr Tickle: “You’re betting eight quid to win one?!”%0a%0aMr Small: “Only if it gets that far, which it shouldn’t do really because there are only two colours, black and red, so if you lose the first one you should really win the second one.”%0a%0aMr Tickle: “Er… no.”%0a%0aMr Small: “Yes, cos you’ve got a 1 in 2 chance.”%0a%0aMr Tickle: “That doesn’t mean you’ll win one of the first two games.”%0a%0aMr Small: “Look it’s not going to get to eight or sixteen, cos it becomes increasingly unlikely that it’ll be red again.”%0a%0a(They are now in the station, and are buying a coffee.)%0a%0aMr Tickle: “No, probabilities don’t work like that. Every time it has the same 1 in 2 chance. It’s unlikely, but it could be red every time.”%0a%0aMr Small: “Don’t be daft.”%0a%0a(At this point we can have Stephen walk behind them with the case, but not get noticed.)%0a%0aMr Tickle: “I’m not, you are. Doubling your bets to win back money you’ve already lost isn’t a new idea. It’s been tried before, usually by people you see on park benches swigging something in a brown paper bag.”%0a%0aMr Small: “You don’t understand. There are only two colours so it won’t get out of hand like it does with people who bet on horses.”%0a%0aMr Tickle: “Actually there’s a third colour as well. Zero doesn’t count as red or black. The house wins all bets if that comes up.”%0a%0aMr Small: “Is that right? Well, it’s only one number out of… how many?”%0a%0aMr Tickle: “I’m not sure…” (he sees something)… “Hey, isn’t that our case?!”%0a%0aMr Small starts fumbling for his gun, but Mr Tickle stops him.%0a%0aMr Tickle: "Wait. This is far too public for that. We’ll follow him."%0a%0a[[#Scene11]]%0a!!!Scene 11: On the train%0a%0aStephen is on the train with the case, looking nervous.%0a%0aMr Small and Mr Tickle are nearby, facing opposite directions.%0a%0aMr Tickle: “What’s he doing?”%0a%0aMr Small: “Just sitting there. He looks nervous.”%0a%0aMr Tickle: “And it’s definitely your case?”%0a%0aMr Small: “Oh yes.”%0a%0a[[#Scene12]]%0a!!!Scene 12: At the station%0a%0aWe see Stephen getting off the train, closely followed by Mr Small and Mr Tickle. Stephen looks over his shoulder nervously, as if he thinks he’s being followed. They all leave the station.%0a%0a[[#Scene13]]%0a!!!Scene 13: A road somewhere%0a%0aStephen is looking over his shoulder, now obviously being followed by Mr Small and Mr Tickle.%0a%0aStephen breaks into a slight run, and dodges down a dark side street (maybe a Close off the Royal Mile). The other men also start running.%0a%0aMr Tickle takes out the big bastard machine gun.%0a%0aMr Tickle (shouting): “Stop right there!”%0a%0aStephen keeps running and disappears into darkness.%0a%0aThen the men start searching in the darkness.%0a%0aWe see Stephen pick up a stone or something and throw it away from him, so that it makes a noise and we see Mr Tickle look towards the noise and raise his gun.%0a%0aMr Tickle looks intently, and sees somebody in the shadows.%0a%0aHe fires (and we have Broon's idea of filming the big bastard machine gun in low light).%0a%0aWe see the man in the shadows more clearly now, and it is Mr Small. He collapses, dead.%0a%0aMr Tickle: “Oh shit!”%0a%0aMr Tickle runs over to Mr Small and checks to see if he has a pulse. His eyes fall when he realises the man is dead.%0a%0aThere is a sudden noise, and Stephen sprints from the shadows where he was hiding (not all that near the men). Mr Tickle tries to shoot Stephen, but his gun jams (or he’s out of ammo). Stephen makes it to the exit safely.%0a%0aMr Tickle is clearly upset at killing Mr Small and then not getting a clean shot at Stephen.%0a%0aHe runs after Stephen, leaving Mr Small.%0a%0a[[#Scene14]]%0a!!!Scene 14: A different road%0a%0aWe see Stephen running along a pavement, pursued by Mr Tickle.%0a%0aMr Tickle: “Stop right there!”%0a%0aStephen gets to a road, and runs across.%0a%0aMr Tickle runs after him.%0a%0aThen Mr Tickle is hit by a car or bus (to be filmed carefully, as discussed).%0a%0aWe see him lying in the road, dead.%0a%0aCredits roll%0a%0a[[#Scene15]]%0a!!!Scene 15: Mr Happy’s private office%0a%0aMr Happy is there.%0a%0aThere is a knock at the door.%0a%0aMr Happy: “Come in”.%0a%0aNasty Dave enters. He has the case with him.%0a%0aMr Happy: “Excellent! Let’s see it.”%0a%0aNasty Dave (opening the case): “There you go. A hundred grand.”%0a%0a[[#Scene16]]%0a!!!Scene 16: Stephen’s house%0a%0aWe now cut to a scene of Stephen opening up the case of money at home, but the dialogue is still by Mr Happy and Nasty Dave.%0a%0a(During this dialogue we see Stephen taking some of the money out of the case, it doesn't quite feel right so he turns it over to see that the other side is blank.)%0a%0aMr Happy: “Not bad. It looks real!”%0a%0aNasty Dave: “Not if you look at the other side. Still, it should be good enough for what you’re doing.”%0a%0aNow we need good acting from Stephen to show his dismay and surprise just by his facial expression.%0a%0a!!!The End%0a%0a[[#CastList]]%0a!!!Cast:%0a%0aStephen Day – Magnox (shirt and tie, salesman outfit, not a black suit)%0a%0aMr Small – Baldas (black suit, white shirt, black tie)%0a%0aMr Bump – Broon (black suit, white shirt, black tie)%0a%0aMr Tickle – Splodgey (black suit, white shirt, black tie)%0a%0aMr Happy – Somebody from ECVS (big sovereign rings, fake cigarette)%0a%0aWoman at door – One of the lard’s bords (casual clothes or apron)%0a%0aMan with coat on train – Any of the lards in a different outfit and a wig (we don’t see the face)%0a%0aSecurity guard – Any of the lards (we don’t see the face) (security guard outfit adapted from police uniform)%0a%0aCounterfeit guy (Nasty Dave) – Roy (round specs, looks like a lawyer)%0a

You got a cool-sounding name. So, Mr. Tickle, if you think "Mr. Small" is no big deal, let’s trade.”%0a%3c Mr Happy: “No trading! Look, this is not a democracy! Listen up Mr. Small.

Very cheap, top quality stuff.”%0a%3c Woman: “Oh, I don’t know… I don’t really need anything…”%0a%3c Stephen: “Please, let me show you what we have…”%0a%3c He opens his case and is about to turn it around to show her the contents, but he stops dead in his tracks when he looks into it. We then see his view inside the case. It is full of money.%0a%3c Stephen: "Oh no…oh no!”%0a%3c He looks up at the woman.%0a%3c Stephen: “Erm… I’ll get back to you later Mrs… erm… I… erm… forgot to bring the right things with me… erm…sorry…”%0a%3c He backs away from the door, closes the case, and walks off in a bit of a panic.%0a%3c Scene: Under Potterrow%0a%3c Back to Mr Tickle and Mr Small again. Mr Bump is lying dead on the ground.%0a%3c Mr Small: "Please, you have to believe me! I wouldn't steal from the firm! We've just established that it was him!” (He points to the dead guy on the ground). “I don't know what happened to the money."%0a%3c Mr Tickle: "I do believe you, mainly because my cousin has such trust in you that he gave you this assignment."%0a%3c Mr Small: "So what do we do?"%0a%3c Mr Tickle: "What do YOU do, you mean. You're the one who lost it."%0a%3c Mr Small: "What?!"%0a%3c Mr Tickle: "Okay, I'll help. It doesn't look good if I'm involved in something like this going wrong."%0a%3c Mr Small: "Gee, thanks…" (sarcastically)%0a%3c Mr Tickle: "Right, let's re-trace your steps from earlier today. Did you put the money in the case?"%0a%3c Mr Small: "No, the boss did, but I saw it."%0a%3c Mr Tickle: "And since then, has the case been out of your sight at all?"%0a%3c Mr Small: "No, I don't think so."%0a%3c Mr Tickle: "Think! Did you put it down at any point?"%0a%3c Mr Small: "On the train yes, I put it in the luggage rack. There wasn't room for it by my legs." (We see a flashback of this during the chat)%0a%3c Mr Tickle: "Any other times?"%0a%3c Mr Small: "No."%0a%3c Mr Tickle: "Right, come with me."%0a%3c They set off.%0a%3c Scene: Near a bridge over a river%0a%3c Stephen is panicking.%0a%3c Stephen: "What am I going to do?!!"%0a%3c He looks around.%0a%3c Stephen (thinks): Right… (We hear his thoughts)%0a%3c He is about to throw the case off the bridge into the river, but stops himself.%0a%3c Stephen (thinks): Hold on… what if somebody comes looking for it?%0a%3c He has another look inside the case.%0a%3c Stephen (thinks): Maybe I’ll just keep it safe at home for a while, until I decide what to do.%0a%3c He walks off (perhaps following a sign to the station).%0a%3c Scene: In a moving car / Then at the station%0a%3c Mr Tickle is driving and Mr Small is in the passenger seat.%0a%3c Mr Small: “Where are we going?”%0a%3c Mr Tickle: “Back to the station. We need to follow up who took that case.”%0a%3c Mr Small: "I don't remember who was near us on the train."%0a%3c Mr Tickle: “We’ll ask a few questions. Maybe talk to the guy at the left luggage office, and see if it’s there for safe keeping. If it is, I’m sure we could persuade him to hand it over to us.” (He pats his jacket where he keeps his gun, and smiles). “In the mean time, keep your eyes peeled.”%0a%3c They drive on for a bit, with Mr Small looking around at people on the street.%0a%3c Mr Small points out of the window at a building they are passing.%0a%3c Mr Small: “There’s the casino.”%0a%3c Mr Tickle: "You been there?”%0a%3c Mr Small: “Yeah. Really top women. I lost a fair bit of cash though.”%0a%3c Mr Tickle: “On the gambling or the women?”%0a%3c Mr Small: “A bit of both. Oh yeah, and I met this bloke who was telling me about a great roulette strategy. It’s incredible. You can’t lose.”%0a%3c Mr Tickle: (sceptically) “Oh yeah? Now this I have to hear!”%0a%3c Mr Small: “What you do, right, is you put a quid on black, okay?”%0a%3c Mr Tickle: “Okay.”%0a%3c Mr Small: “And if that comes up then fine, you win, and you keep doing that. But if red comes up…”%0a%3c Mr Tickle (interrupting): “Which tends to happen sometimes…”%0a%3c Mr Small: “Yes, it does, so you lose that pound, and next time you put two pounds on black. If that comes up then you win and you go back to one pound on black, but if it’s red again you go up to four pounds.”%0a%3c Mr Tickle: “And you keep increasing your stake like this?”%0a%3c Mr Small: “Only until you win. Then you go back to a quid.”%0a%3c (At this point they arrive at the station, park and get out of the car. The camera view changes, but the conversation carries on, uninterrupted.)%0a%3c Mr Tickle: “So, let me see… if you lose the four quid bet you’re now seven quid down overall, so you bet eight in the hope of winning eight to make you one quid up?”%0a%3c Mr Small: “Exactly! Brilliant eh? So you never actually lose anything!”%0a%3c Mr Tickle: “You’re betting eight quid to win one?!”%0a%3c Mr Small: “Only if it gets that far, which it shouldn’t do really because there are only two colours, black and red, so if you lose the first one you should really win the second one.”%0a%3c Mr Tickle: “Er… no.”%0a%3c Mr Small: “Yes, cos you’ve got a 1 in 2 chance.”%0a%3c Mr Tickle: “That doesn’t mean you’ll win one of the first two games.”%0a%3c Mr Small: “Look it’s not going to get to eight or sixteen, cos it becomes increasingly unlikely that it’ll be red again.”%0a%3c (They are now in the station, and are buying a coffee.)%0a%3c Mr Tickle: “No, probabilities don’t work like that. Every time it has the same 1 in 2 chance. It’s unlikely, but it could be red every time.”%0a%3c Mr Small: “Don’t be daft.”%0a%3c (At this point we can have Stephen walk behind them with the case, but not get noticed.)%0a%3c Mr Tickle: “I’m not, you are. Doubling your bets to win back money you’ve already lost isn’t a new idea. It’s been tried before, usually by people you see on park benches swigging something in a brown paper bag.”%0a%3c Mr Small: “You don’t understand. There are only two colours so it won’t get out of hand like it does with people who bet on horses.”%0a%3c Mr Tickle: “Actually there’s a third colour as well. Zero doesn’t count as red or black. The house wins all bets if that comes up.”%0a%3c Mr Small: “Is that right? Well, it’s only one number out of… how many?”%0a%3c Mr Tickle: “I’m not sure…” (he sees something)… “Hey, isn’t that our case?!”%0a%3c Mr Small starts fumbling for his gun, but Mr Tickle stops him.%0a%3c Mr Tickle: "Wait. This is far too public for that. We’ll follow him."%0a%3c Scene: On the train%0a%3c Stephen is on the train with the case, looking nervous.%0a%3c Mr Small and Mr Tickle are nearby, facing opposite directions.%0a%3c Mr Tickle: “What’s he doing?”%0a%3c Mr Small: “Just sitting there. He looks nervous.”%0a%3c Mr Tickle: “And it’s definitely your case?”%0a%3c Mr Small: “Oh yes.”%0a%3c Scene: At the station%0a%3c We see Stephen getting off the train, closely followed by Mr Small and Mr Tickle. Stephen looks over his shoulder nervously, as if he thinks he’s being followed. They all leave the station.%0a%3c Scene: A road somewhere%0a%3c Stephen is looking over his shoulder, now obviously being followed by Mr Small and Mr Tickle.%0a%3c Stephen breaks into a slight run, and dodges down a dark side street (maybe a Close off the Royal Mile). The other men also start running.%0a%3c Mr Tickle takes out the big bastard machine gun.%0a%3c Mr Tickle (shouting): “Stop right there!”%0a%3c Stephen keeps running and disappears into darkness.%0a%3c Then the men start searching in the darkness.%0a%3c We see Stephen pick up a stone or something and throw it away from him, so that it makes a noise and we see Mr Tickle look towards the noise and raise his gun.%0a%3c Mr Tickle looks intently, and sees somebody in the shadows.%0a%3c He fires (and we have Broon's idea of filming the big bastard machine gun in low light).%0a%3c We see the man in the shadows more clearly now, and it is Mr Small. He collapses, dead.%0a%3c Mr Tickle: “Oh shit!”%0a%3c Mr Tickle runs over to Mr Small and checks to see if he has a pulse. His eyes fall when he realises the man is dead.%0a%3c There is a sudden noise, and Stephen sprints from the shadows where he was hiding (not all that near the men). Mr Tickle tries to shoot Stephen, but his gun jams (or he’s out of ammo). Stephen makes it to the exit safely.%0a%3c Mr Tickle is clearly upset at killing Mr Small and then not getting a clean shot at Stephen.%0a%3c He runs after Stephen, leaving Mr Small.%0a%3c Scene: A different road%0a%3c We see Stephen running along a pavement, pursued by Mr Tickle.%0a%3c Mr Tickle: “Stop right there!”%0a%3c Stephen gets to a road, and runs across.%0a%3c Mr Tickle runs after him.%0a%3c Then Mr Tickle is hit by a car or bus (to be filmed carefully, as discussed).%0a%3c We see him lying in the road, dead.%0a%3c Credits roll%0a%3c Scene: Mr Happy’s private office%0a%3c Mr Happy is there.%0a%3c There is a knock at the door.%0a%3c Mr Happy: “Come in”.%0a%3c Nasty Dave enters. He has the case with him.%0a%3c Mr Happy: “Excellent! Let’s see it.”%0a%3c Nasty Dave (opening the case): “There you go. A hundred grand.”%0a%3c Scene: Stephen’s house%0a%3c We now cut to a scene of Stephen opening up the case of money at home, but the dialogue is still by Mr Happy and Nasty Dave.%0a%3c (During this dialogue we see Stephen taking some of the money out of the case, it doesn't quite feel right so he turns it over to see that the other side is blank.)%0a%3c Mr Happy: “Not bad. It looks real!”%0a%3c Nasty Dave: “Not if you look at the other side. Still, it should be good enough for what you’re doing.”%0a%3c Now we need good acting from Stephen to show his dismay and surprise just by his facial expression.%0a%3c The End%0a%3c %0a%3c Cast:%0a%3c Stephen Day – Magnox (shirt and tie, salesman outfit, not a black suit)%0a%3c Mr Small – Baldas (black suit, white shirt, black tie)%0a%3c Mr Bump – Broon (black suit, white shirt, black tie)%0a%3c Mr Tickle – Splodgey (black suit, white shirt, black tie)%0a%3c Mr Happy – Somebody from ECVS (big sovereign rings, fake cigarette)%0a%3c Woman at door – One of the lard’s bords (casual clothes or apron)%0a%3c Man with coat on train – Any of the lards in a different outfit and a wig (we don’t see the face)%0a%3c Security guard – Any of the lards (we don’t see the face) (security guard outfit adapted from police uniform)%0a%3c Counterfeit guy (Nasty Dave) – Roy (round specs, looks like a lawyer)%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
