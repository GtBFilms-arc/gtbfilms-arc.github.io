It's a funeral. Our hero is dead, and lies on display in an open casket on the table. Friends and relatives are milling round eating little sandwiches and paying their last respects.[[%3c%3c]][[%3c%3c]]%0aThe reason everyone is at the funeral is to contest the will, because it turns out Fred has left everything to Charity, and they all think they are entitled to a share for various reasons.[[%3c%3c]]%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0aFrom time to time, groups of two approach the casket and in hushed tones talk about the deceased.
