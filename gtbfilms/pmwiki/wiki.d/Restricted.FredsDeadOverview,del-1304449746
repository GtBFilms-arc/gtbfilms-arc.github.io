text=Film opens on a newspaper, panning down the obituary column, it comes%0ato one printed bigger than the rest, it just says:%0a%0a %0a               '''FRED'S''' [[%3c%3c]]%0a                '''DEAD''' [[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a Memorial Service 2pm Thursday [[%3c%3c]]%0a All interested parties please attend [[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a%0a%0aFades to black, fade up on room with guy lying in an open coffin. Some%0apeople milling about. They are there to pay their last respects before%0athe burial.%0aFunereal type music plays.%0a%0aMidshot across the top of the coffin, you can see Fred at the bottom%0aof the screen, two people come up to look at the body.%0a%0aThey talk about how he died. They reckon it was when he was in the%0abetting shop and had a big win, then had a heart attack. As they%0aspeak, a series of black and white stills quickly fade in one after%0athe other, they show Fred when alive with a betting slip, shot of%0ahorse racing on TV, shot of Fred clasping his chest etc.%0a%0aFade back to original shot, the people finish their conversation and move on.%0a%0aNext couple come up, and they talk about how Fred died, they heard a%0atotally different story involving throwing the road atlas out the car%0awindow, it blows on the windscreen and he crashed into a tree. Again%0aas they recount the story, it is illustrated with a series of black%0aand white stills.%0a%0aFart joke in here somewhere "Is it supposed to do that?" - I would%0ahave one of the people at that point being a solemn vicar, because I%0athink that makes if funnier.%0a%0aThey move on, the last two people come up. They heard yet another%0astory about how Fred died - he was birdwatching with binoculars up a%0atree, and he fell out the tree and was killed by the fall. Again, a%0aseries of B&W stills to show the events, however, this time the stills%0ashow the story is not quite correct, as Fred was using the binoculars%0ato spy in people's windows, just to give his character a bit more%0acolour.%0a%0aRight, that's all the props out of the way - each one was somehow%0ainvolved in his possible method of death.%0a%0aNow the twist, Fred sits up and declares he's not dead at all! This is%0athe reason everyone got conflicting stories about what happened to%0ahim.%0a%0aHe has faked his own funeral to see what they all said about him,%0a(need to add more dialogue to the above three segments to have them%0aslagging him off a bit). All this because he was trying to decide who%0ato write his will out to.%0a%0aMaybe all those people turned up because they heard he had recently%0achanged his will to leave everything to charity and they all%0apreviously were going to get a share, so they turn up at the funeral%0aand slag him off for writing them out the will.%0a%0aAnyway, he's not dead. But he now knows what everyone thinks of him,%0aand decides none of them are worthy of a share.%0a%0a"So you are going to leave it all to Charity now after all then Fred?" one asks.%0a%0a"No, I've booked a round the world trip and a 2 week stop pver in Las%0aVegas" says Fred, "after all..." turns directly to camera "Charity%0abegins at home".%0a%0a'''The End.'''%0a%0a%0aNeeds a lot of work on the dialogue though.%0a%0aI think the people talking over the coffin, and the final scene could%0aall be done in a morning. The stills couldn't. But we only need one%0aperson to play Fred and be in the stills, so they can be done any%0atime. They could even be done before we go. Fred needs to be played by%0asomeone who is going to be available for still shooting at another%0atime though. But he doesn't need to be an actor, because Fred only has%0aa few lines in the whole film.%0a%0aThe named characters I would make two of the people who talk about him%0aat the coffin. Could drop their names into the conversation or%0asomething. I would make one of them the Vicar - as he probably will%0arequire the most acting ability, to be believeable.%0a%0aThe props needed are the binoculars, betting slip, road atlas. Also a%0acoffin. And a vicars outfit (I have one). Maybe also some fake%0aflowers. Fred might be wearing a suit or something. Everything else is%0ajust what we have to hand. The hardest thing is the coffin.
