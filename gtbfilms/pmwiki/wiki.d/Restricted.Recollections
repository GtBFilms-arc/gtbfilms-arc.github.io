text=(:title Recollections:)%0a%0a'Recollections' is the working title for a proposed new short film from GtBFilms.\\\%0a%0aThe script is currently in draft form and can be viewed/edited below:\\\%0a%0aScript Version 0.01 'Recollections' (working title)\\\%0a%0a'''SCENE 1''' - A residential street, there are a few people out and about, a woman (Victim) carrying an envelope of money, taking her bosses cash to the local bank, a skateboarder, a milkman delivering milk, a couple in a car drive along the street, they are arguing about something.%0a%0aThere are shots from various different angles of other people in the street going about their daily business. \\\%0a%0aShot 1 - Woman wandering along the street.\\%0aShot 2 - Woman walks past the skateboarder, he does a jump or something and she has to avoid him, she tuts at him, obviously annoyed.\\%0aShot 3 - From other side of the road, the Milkman is delivering some pints of milk, whistling to himself, he is also listening to an ipod. You can see the woman and skateboarder from a different angle here.\\%0aShot 4 - Inside the car, from the back seat, the couple are arguing about the woman's brother coming to stay.\\%0aWoman: "He hasn't got anywhere else to go, since she threw him out the house, and he is my brother..."\\%0aMan: "I'm about sick of bailing him out, every time he get's thrown out, he has to come and stay with us, and he hogs the telly, drinks all the beer out the fridge, and does he every replace any of it? No he doesn't."\\%0aWoman: "That's not his fault, since he lost his job..."\\%0aMan: "That's another thing, when is he going to sort himself out and..."\\%0aThrough the windscreen you can see the other characters all going about their business.\\\%0a%0aShot 5 - back to long shot.\\%0aThe woman is walking along minding her own business with all this going on and suddenly some bloke goes past and grabs her%0ahandbag and runs off with it! That's all very fast, so you don't see much detail of the attacker, plus he's wearing a hoody.\\\%0a%0aVictim: "Hey! Stop! I've just been robbed!"\\\%0a%0aFade to black.\\\%0a%0a%0a'''SCENE 2''' - Inside a Police Interview Room\\\%0aThis will be filmed in the blue room at ECVS, but using the non-blue side of the room, as it looks pretty plain. It's a police%0ainterview room for this scenario, and there is a table and a tape recorder on it. A uniformed police guy is standing at the door (also he comes and goes with a tray with tea on it and that from time to time). This would be played by whoever was the attacker in scene 1 probably.\\\%0a%0aAlso in the room is a plain clothes detective in a suit, and he is interviewing all the people you saw in the previous scene asking them what they saw, and of course they all come up with different descriptions of what happened, and what the attacker looked like.\\\%0a%0aInterview of Victim\\%0aDetective: Can you take me though what happened, step by step?\\\%0a%0aVictim: Well I was taking the weekly cash from the shop to the bank. I wouldn't usually do it, but Mr Phillips said because Stacey was off on the sick, that I'd need to take it on my way home, and it meant that I could finish half an hour early, and I said that's okay because Steve was supposed to be taking me to the cinema tonight, to see that new thing with the talking dog in it, and he wasn't too keen on that, but I said it sounds like it would be good and...\\\%0a%0a[May fade to a black and white sequence of the victim and her boss earlier in the day, with him giving her a bundle of money, putting it in an envelope for her]\\\%0a%0aDetective: Okay, so you were taking the money to the bank and...?\\\%0a%0aVictim: Yes well I wasn't thinking too much about it you know, it's usually Stacey that does that, and I was just wondering what to wear tonight, so I wasn't paying much attention really, and next thing I know some guy just grabbed the money and ran off, I didn't get much time to react or anything.\\\%0a%0aDetective: Did you get a good look at him? Can you describe him for me, his height, age, what he was wearing?\\\%0a%0aVictim: Not really, I think he was about 20, average height, he was wearing a shellsuit, I'm pretty sure yes, a shellsuit. And he had a lot of jewellery on, gold chains.\\\%0a%0aDetective: What about his hair, what colour was it?\\\%0a%0aVictim: Erm, ginger. Yes definitely ginger.\\\%0a%0aDetective: Okay Miss, we might need to speak to you later. If there's anything else you remember that might help, let us know.\\\%0a%0a'''SCENE 3''' - Inside a Police Interview Room\\\%0aThe skateboarder is in the room with the detective.\\\%0a%0aDetective: So you witnessed the incident taking place?\\\%0a%0aSkater: Not really no, I was just practicing a butterlip beanplant pressure flip, I'd just about got it nailed, and this woman got in the way, next thing I know she's shouting some shit about being robbed.\\\%0a%0aDetective: But you did see her assailant?\\\%0a%0aSkater: Yeah some guy robbed her, I wasn't paying much notice to be honest, I'd switched to practising a switch foot pogo into old school kickflip combo by then.\\\%0a%0aDetective: So can you describe the man?\\\%0a%0aSkater: Uh, maybe. He was dark, like olive skinned, Mediterranean or something. Jet black hair.  And a beard. Like a goatee beard.\\\%0a%0aDetective: What was he wearing?\\\%0a%0aSkater: A suit I think, yeah a suit, like some sort of businessman. Really square looking office monkey.\\\%0a%0aDetective: How old do you think he was?\\\%0a%0aSkater: Hmm probably 40-something. Maybe older.\\\%0a%0aDetective: Okay, that's all the questions I have for you now. If you remember anything else, be sure to let me know.\\\%0a%0a'''SCENE 4''' - Inside a Police Interview Room\\\%0aThe milkman is in the room with the detective.\\\%0a%0aDetective: So you were working when the incident occurred?\\\%0a%0aMilkman: Yeah, I do that round every day, I had just finished delivering 2 pints to number 26. They always take 2 pints there, ever since I can remember. I was just coming back to the van, and I saw the guy grab that woman's money and make off.\\\%0a%0aDetective: Good, can you describe him?\\\%0a%0aMilkman: Yeah, it was one of them foreigners weren't it? Looked like a German to me, what with the blonde hair and that.\\\%0a%0aDetective: A German?\\\%0a%0aMilkman: Well, might not have been a German. But you know, one of them Europeans. Always up to no good they are. Or could have been an Irish.\\\%0a%0aDetective: Hmmm, how old would you say he was?\\\%0a%0aMilkman: I would say mid 20s. Difficult to say on account of him being so tall though. 6 and a half foot if he was an inch. Towered over that poor woman, she didn't stand a chance against him.\\\%0a%0aDetective: Can you recall what he was wearing?\\\%0a%0aMilkman: Yeah, a football shirt. That's how comes I was thinking he was a German you see, it was a German football shirt.\\\%0a%0aDetective: Okay, I think that's about all for now, if we need any more information we'll be in touch.\\\%0a%0a%0a'''SCENE 5''' - Inside a Police Interview Room\\\%0aThe arguing couple from the car are in the room with the detective.\\\%0a%0aDetective: Okay you were driving past when the robbery took place, do remember any details that might help us with our enquiries?\\\%0a%0aWoman: I wasn't paying much attention, we were having a bit of a, erm, discussion at the time.\\\%0a%0aMan: It wasn't a discussion it was a argument, about her bloody brother.\\\%0a%0aDetective: Okay, well, setting that aside for a moment, can you remember anything about the assailant?\\\%0a%0aMan: It was a little guy wasn't it, I remember thinking at the time it was just kids mucking about, and then I realised he was older, but small, about 3 foot.\\\%0a%0aWoman: He wasn't a dwarf!\\\%0a%0aMan: Maybe not 3 foot, maybe 5 foot.\\\%0a%0aDetective: Can you remember what he was wearing?\\\%0a%0aWoman: Oh yes, he was wearing a leather jacket, black leather jacket, and blue jeans.\\\%0a%0aMan: I don't remember that. That doesn't sound right, it was an anorak, plastic, not leather. Cheap looking.\\\%0a%0aWoman: I know a leather jacket when I see one, are you saying I don't know a leather jacket when I see one?\\\%0a%0aMan: (sheepishly) Might have been a leather jacket.\\\%0a%0aDetective: Anything else you can remember?\\\%0a%0aWoman: Well he was bald, I rememeber that for sure.\\\%0a%0aMan: Bald? He was wearing a hat!\\\%0a%0aWoman: Yeah, bald definitely. A bald midget.\\\%0a%0aMan: You're thinking of your brother.\\\%0a%0aWoman: Don't you start about my brother again... I'll.....\\\%0a%0aDetective: (shakes head slowly)\\\%0a%0aUniformed Officer comes into the room.\\\%0a%0aUniform: Excuse me sir, we've had a development, we've managed to locate some CCTV footage of the incident which I think you should see...\\\%0a%0aDetective gets up to leave with uniformed officer.\\\%0a%0aFade into scene 6.\\\%0a%0a'''SCENE 6''' - The CCTV footage\\\%0aView from a static CCTV camera of what happened.\\\%0a%0aThe scene plays out as if from a static CCTV camera, the same stuff is going on as before, but as the woman walks up near the camera location it zooms in and some jogger runs past her, bumping into her slightly, the camera is zoomed pretty close in and you see her with a thoughtful look on her face, in an instant she drops the envelope full of money into her handbag. Then glancing round to see who is looking (and that the jogger has gone out of earshot) she starts to shout "Help I've been robbed!" (but it's silent on CCTV of course).\\\%0a%0a'''SCENE 7''' - Epilogue (optional)\\\%0a%0aDetective and the Uniformed Police Officer.\\\%0a%0a(Dialogue to be added)\\%0aDetective: \\\%0a%0a%0a'''THE END'''\\\%0a%0a'''Possible Changes'''\\%0aThe milkman is pretty dated, and you don't really get them nowadays. We could replace the milkman with a tramp maybe.\\%0aThe various interviews above are in chronological order, we could mix them up a bit, with excerpts from different interviews occurring in each scene.\\%0aSome of the interviews could have flashbacks of what the witness is recalling, from their point of view.\\%0a%0a\\\%0a'''Cast:'''\\%0aVictim\\%0aAttacker/uniformed policeman\\%0aDetective\\%0aSkateboarder\\%0aMan in Car\\%0aWoman in Car\\%0aMilkman\\%0aVictims Boss (optional)\\\%0a%0a'''Shooting Schedule:'''\\%0aSaturday 27th February (although we have a ceilidh in the evening so not ideal)\\%0aSunday 28th February\\%0aSaturday 13th March\\%0aSunday 14th March\\%0aSaturday 20th March (There is a girls thing at the Splodges in the evening this day)\\%0aSunday 21st March\\\%0a%0a'''Production:'''%0a||border=1 width=60%25 align=left%0a||Director ||[[Actors/BrownAlan | Alan Brown]] ||%0a||Cameras ||[[Actors/BrownAlan | Alan Brown ]] ||||%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a%0a[[#Downloads]]%0a'''Downloads'''\\\%0a%0a%0a%0a(:html:)%0a%3ccenter>%0a%3cscript type="text/javascript">%3c!--%0agoogle_ad_client = "pub-5767714101223561";%0agoogle_ad_width = 728;%0agoogle_ad_height = 90;%0agoogle_ad_format = "728x90_as";%0agoogle_ad_type = "text_image";%0a//2007-09-12: GtBFilms%0agoogle_ad_channel = "8003625449";%0agoogle_ui_features = "rc:10";%0a//-->%0a%3c/script>%0a%3cscript type="text/javascript"%0a  src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js">%0a%3c/script>%0a%3c/center>%0a(:htmlend:)
