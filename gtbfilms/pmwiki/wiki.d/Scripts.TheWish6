text=Scene 1 - Study%0a%0aFilm opens with a dimly lit room, and some guy, lets call him Fred for now is hunched over a PC. There is my wee green lamp lighting the desk, and apart from the glow from the screen that is the only illumination. The lamp is a bit dirty on top. He is scratching his head from time to time, then peering at the screen over his specs before typing furiously for a few moments.%0a%0aFreds wife comes into the room, she is called, erm Freda for now.%0a%0aFreda: "Are you still working?"%0aFred:  "Yeah, I have to get this work finished before tomorrows deadline"%0aFreda: "Why on earth did the editor put you in charge of the horoscope page? You have to be the least superstitious person I've ever met..."%0aFred: "We're short staffed right now, ever since the horoscope guy had to leave due to...erm....unforseen circumstances. Ha ha! Everyone knows this stuff is all just made up anyway, I wish I *COULD* see the future, but I can't."%0a%0aAs he is saying the above, Freda notices the dirty mark on the lamp shade, she picks up a conveniently places cloth from the desk, and rubs it clean just as he is saying the last bit. No further explanation of this will be given, it is just a wee sort of bit that you either 'get' or you don't.%0a%0aFreda: "Well when are you coming to bed?"%0aFred: "I'm on Saggitarius, it'll only take another five minutes, max."%0a%0aFreda leaves the room, seemingly happy with this response, and Fred continues to study  the screen, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.%0a%0a%0aScene 2 - 3 days later, a kitchen%0a%0aFreda is looking through the mail, Fred is doodling on a newspaper and eating his breakfast, a radio is on in the background.%0a%0aFreda: "Your horoscope page is going down a treat! Have you seen these letters, all these people reckon your predictions are spot on!"%0aFred: "Yeah, some people will believe anything! I didn't realise it could be so easy to pull the wool over everyones eyes"%0aFreda: "Are you going to answer some of these letters today?"%0aFred: "Not likely, its Saturday, I'm not spending my one day off on that! I've got things to do!"%0aFreda: "What are your plans for today?" %0aFred: "I'm going round to Daves, he has an important, erm, project he is working on"%0aFreda: "What's that?"%0aFred: "Oh, erm, I'm not sure...Its very important, I'll tell you later"%0aRadio: NEWS: The hunt continues for the missing climbers reported lost in the Scottish Highlands, the climbers, who set out 4 days ago, have not been heard of since Tuesday, mountain rescue teams have scoured the area for the past 24 hours, but have yet to locate the missing climbers. As fears for their safety grows, relatives keep a 24hr vigil at blah blah"%0aFreda: "Those climbers are still missing, I hope they are okay"%0aFred: "Do not worry about that, they will have found shelter someplace, and will be waiting for the weather to improve, right I'm off, I'll see you later.."%0a%0aFred leaves, and Freda starts tidying up the table, she picks up the newspaper, and looks at it, it has some squiggly doodles on it, and amongst them there are six numbers: 20, 42, 6, 14, 31 and 33, she shrugs and chucks it in the bin.%0a%0aScene 3 - Daves House%0a%0aFred is at Daves house, they are sprawled out in front of the telly with some beers and crisps and that. They are watching the horse racing on the telly.%0a%0aDave: "You are on a roll mate, 3 wins out of 3 races, what have you gone for on this one?"%0aFred: "I dunno, I have a good feeling about number 3, "Putrid Smegma", so I have put a tenner on the nose"%0aDave: "That's a fifty to one shot! You've got no chance!"%0aThe race starts, and we get shots of the race/shots of the blokes reacting.%0aThis is stock footage of a horse race on the telly, with voice over redone.%0a...and number 3 wins!%0a%0aDave: "What a result, you really are on a winnins streak today"%0aFred: "I certainly looks like it, right I am away to collect my winnings from the bookies"%0a%0aScene 4 - Back at Freds House%0aFreda is watching the telly, and it is the NEWS - Leroy TV again. There is a news story about those climbers, and they have been discovered, as they had sought out shelter until the eather improved, just like Fred said, then there are the lottery results.%0a%0aFreda watches the lottery results onscreen, then looks thoughtful.%0a%0aShe goes over to the bin and fishes out the newspaper - and the numbers are the winning lottery numbers! Freda gasps and sits doon.%0a%0aFred arrives home looking cheerful.%0a%0aFreda: "Fred, what are these numbers?" (holding up the newspaper with the scribbles on it)%0aFred: "I dunno, I was just doodling, why, what's wrong?"%0aFreda: "These are the EXACT same numbers as the winning numbers on tonights lottery!"%0aFred: "Are you sure?"%0aFreda: "Yes! They were on the TV right now!"%0aFred: "What a coincidence! I wish I'd bought a ticket now!"%0aFreda: "You were right about those climbers as well, it was on the news!"%0aFred: "I seem to be having a run of good luck right now certainly..."%0aFreda: "It's more than that, come over here, let's do an experiment..."%0a%0aSo they do an experiment with a pack of cards, and Freda holds them up with their back to Fred, and he can predict what each one is! They do this for quite a few, before the enormity of Freds new future-prediction skills sinks in.%0a%0aFred: "This is Fantastic! Think of the money we can make!"%0aFreda: "Well you could use it for other tings as well, but yes, see if you can predict next weeks lottery numbers!"%0a%0aScene 4 - Bedroom%0aFred and Freda are going to bed, and they are discussing how excellent it this new found skill is, it is for sure great to see the near future, and how they will have no more worries ever again and all that. And they switch off the light and got to sleep%0a%0aScene 5 - dream%0aWe have a dream of a chase through a wood, and like before it is blurry roond the edges to indicate a dream, and there is someone chasing someone through some dark woods, and there is a knifing and that, and the victim falls over, and is deid, and the mirderer turns the body over, and we see that it is Fred!%0a%0aScene 6 - Bedroom%0aFred wakes up and sits bold upright in bed, he is all covered in sweat and that and has terror in his wide open eyes...%0a%0aTHE END
