It's another cold and wintery morning, and the time is just coming up to a half past 7 am, time to get up! You're listening to RADIO LEROY, and here’s the news headlines you’re waking up to this morning….”%0a%0a%0aBeepity beepity beep…%0a%0a“A Frenchman who raced through a motorway road block, triggering a high-speed police car chase that ended in a minor crash, has blamed aliens from Mars for his reckless driving. %0aUnder police custody in a hospital in the Mediterranean city of Marseille, the 42-year-old told police he was being "chased by Martians" when he charged through a road block on the A55 motorway Monday evening, police sources said.%0aA breathalyzer test for alcohol proved negative, but police are still awaiting the results of drugs tests and a psychiatric examination.”%0a%0a“A bizarre rumor that Malawi's government is colluding with vampires to collect human blood for international aid agencies in exchange for food has led to a rash of vigilante violence. %0aPresident Bakili Muluzi accused unnamed opposition politicians on Sunday of spreading the vampire stories to try to undermine his government, already hit by political protests and widespread food shortages.%0aVampire paranoia has sparked several attacks on suspected bloodsuckers, despite official efforts to kill the rumor.%0aLast week a man accused of helping vampires was stoned to death and three Roman Catholic   priests were beaten up by villagers who suspected them of being bloodsuckers.%0aBoth attacks happened in the southern tea-growing district of Thyolo.%0aMuluzi told a news conference on Sunday the vampire stories were malicious and irresponsible. "No government can go about sucking blood of its own people," he said. "That's thuggery."“%0a%0a“In home news, the Ministry of Defence has announced the commencement of a series of urban missile tests, as their latest weapon in the fight against terrorism, environmental campaigners have expressed alarm at the possible  detrimental effects on the peace and quiet of city green belts”%0a%0a“That’s todays news, and this is Bachman Turner Overdrive, You ain’t seen nothing yet...." more music.... %0a%0aThen there is a beep beep beep of an alarm clock. (All this part is still while the title and%0athat are flashing up). %0a%0aSo then the black screen splits in a transition effect, with the bottom half going down, and the top half going up, revealing the footage behind. The footage behind is of a bedroom, but it is all blurred and that, so the black screen halves close down again, then%0aopen up again - it is still all blurred, and two hands come up from the%0abottom of shot, and make like they are rubbing the viewers eyes, with like%0aa squeaky squeaky noise. When they go down again, the scene is all in%0afocus properly%0a%0aCut to a long shot of some lad sitting up in bed. He reaches over to the bedside table and switches off the alarm that has been beep beeping all that time, and then he switches of the radio - and the music soundtrack stops as he does it. %0a%0a%0aSCENE 2%0a%0aNext scene is him dressed and that and he comes into his%0akitchen/livingroom and his wife is all nagging and that:%0a%0aWife:%0a“When are you going to empty that bin?”%0a“When are you going to do those dishes?”%0a“When are you going to do the hoovering?”%0a“Have you made the bed?”%0a“Can you wash the floor?”%0a“When are you going to make me a cup of tea?” “It’s not too much to ask”    and there is a%0awee baby screaming and all that, and there are some of them zooming in%0adruggy shots of the kettle boiling and other noisy things, and the nagging%0agetting louder and more repetitive and that, and the same with the%0ascreaming, and eventually he goes:   Bloke: “THAT’S IT!”   ….everything  is suddenly totally quiet at that and he goes   "I am going out for some PEACE AND QUIET".%0a Bloke Leaves  SCENE 3 3.1 %0aSo then in the next scene he is getting on a bus.  Shot of him waiting for a bus, it turns up and he climbs on.  3.1  Guy comes up the stairs and sits down on bus. Camera will be on the front seats looking back down the bus and he sits down right in front of it.  Then there is some other lad with headphones, large headphones, he comes along and sits down behind the first guy, on the outside seat with the furst guy near the window so you can see them both.  %0aThe load music from the headphones will be dubbed on later, but we see it is annoying him, and the guy behind wearing the headphones is oblivious to this. Then he gets off the bus (not shown)  SCENE 4 4.1  Somewhere peaceful, with a seat. (check round at the spooky hoose).  Longshot of him walking up to seat and sitting down.  Switch to Close up.  Takes cigar from jacket pocket and makes as if to light it, in background need lad walking past into background and proceeding to play trumpet (puts hat down for change).  Guy looks grumpy and puts cigar away, gets up.  Switch to long shot of him walking away.  4.2  Goes to next location (Possibly Airport) and noise of planes puts him off this time.
