The camera sweeps up onto the sofa to a pair of feet, and then up along the person's body until it finally comes to rest on their face, which they are stuffing with a HUGE bag of crisps as they sit transfixed to the TV, eating and drinking beer. This shot took quite a few takes to get right, but I think the final effect is pretty much what we were looking for. Of course each take was slightly different, and you may notice the unexplained inclusion of a severed hand on the sofa in the final cut, this was added in by one of our actors in boredom at the umpteenth take! || http://www.gonadovision.homeip.net/video/photos/wam1_1.jpg ||%0a%0a%0a|| border=0 width=90%25 align=center%0a||The news programme that our main character ([[Characters/Norris | 'Norris Austerberry' ]] watches also appears later in the story, it's our solution to getting the audience up to speed, and explaining the storyline without too much contrived dialogue.
