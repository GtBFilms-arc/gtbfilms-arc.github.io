We had some issues with the footage though, the bluescreen stuff had the edges of the screen visible (can be cropped off) but more of a problem is the lighting, while we got rid of shadows, we managed to get bright spots on the blue screen, meaning that every colour from dark blue to white needs to be removed, which causes the actors to disappear, the range is so big.\\\%0a%0a http://www.gonadovision.homeip.net/video/identity/badbluescreen.jpg %0a%0aThe best I have been able to do with chromakeying this is:%0a%0ahttp://www.gonadovision.homeip.net/video/identity/badbluescreen2.jpg%0a%0a...due to the wide variation in the blue screen brightness.%0a%0aAlthough with a bright background it is not quite so bad, but there is a distracting shimmering artifact on the background, and put up the similarity one more step from this and the actors trousers disappear!%0a%0a http://www.gonadovision.homeip.net/video/identity/badbluescreen4.jpg %0a%0aMaybe with a bright, busy background we can get away with it, but there is still a noticeable shimmer.%0a%0aAlternatively, we leave them against a blue screen, and do not try to chromakey it out.%0a%0a----%0aUpdate 20/02/06\\%0a%0aI have decided to try using a video of static as the blue-screen background, which should hopefully mask the artifacts, while looking like the characters are in some kind of static void.\\%0a%0a----%0aUpdate 23/02/06\\%0a%0aGood News! With a moving matrix-style background, not far from the original blue of the screen, we just about get away with it!\\\%0a%0ahttp://www.gonadovision.homeip.net/video/identity/badbluescreen5.jpg%0a%0aNote the above has been cropped as well, the closeup looks better:%0a%0ahttp://www.gonadovision.homeip.net/video/identity/badbluescreen6.jpg%0a%0a----%0a%0aOriginal by Baldas 17/02/06%0aUpdated by GtB 17/02/06 13:00 %0a%0a* '''Protect Your Identity'''\\\%0a%0aTitles: The words IDENTITY and THEFT appear on the screen, and a hand comes in from the side and steals a couple of letters.%0a%0aWe see Man 1 standing somewhere (possibly outside). He is wearing a shirt and tie and glasses.%0a%0aUnseen announcer: "Protect yourself from identity theft!"%0a%0aMan 2 walks into view. He is dressed differently to Man 1, and isn't wearing glasses. He reaches across to Man 1 and takes his glasses and puts them on himself. There is a flash and now they have instantly swapped clothing and wigs as well. Man 2 starts walking away.%0a%0aAnnouncer: "Is this identity theft?"%0a%0aClose-up of the faces of Man 1 and Man 2 waiting keenly for the answer to this question.%0a%0aAnnouncer: "No it isn't."%0a%0aAnother flash, and Man 1 and Man 2 swap back to their original clothing/wigs/glasses.%0a%0aAnnouncer: "Identity theft is much worse than that."%0a%0aMan 1 is opening his credit card bill. There are lots of items with big figures next to them. No company names are mentioned, just things like "Betting shop £300, Off licence £100, Supermarket £200, Saucy Sues Marital Aids £350, Electrical store £1000". We hear him saying things like "What on earth?" and "I didn't spend that!".%0a%0ahttp://www.gonadovision.homeip.net/video/identity/bankstatement.jpg %0a%0aHis eyes (and our camera) focus on the figure at the bottom, £5000 or whatever, and we hear a "good grief" from our man.%0a%0aAnnouncer: "How did this happen?"%0a%0aWe see Man 1 standing inside his house, and our camera view pulls right back so that we see the garden and then the edge of the street, and then the wheely bin outside his house. %0a%0aCaption at bottom of screen saying "Last Week...". \\\%0a%0ahttp://www.gonadovision.homeip.net/video/identity/1weekearlier.jpg%0a\\\%0aMan 2 is rummaging through the bin. He finds an old bank statement (again faked, maybe from "Bank Of Britain", but it looks real and has Man 1's name and address on it). There is an electricity bill as well, maybe from British Power. %0a%0aMan 2 runs off with them.%0a%0aAnnouncer: "With a few household bills or bank statements of yours, somebody can pretend to be you. Infact from an electronic point of view, they ARE YOU"%0a%0a----%0a '''This section was filmed, but removed from the final cut to remain'''%0a '''under the 1 min running time limit'''%0a%0a Man 2 is holding the bills he stole, sitting in a darkened room, and his face morphs into that\\%0aof Man 1, who starts laughing evilly. We could possibly use that Matrix style effect as part\\%0aof the morph here.%0a%0a Announcer: "And the consequences might be more than financial".%0a%0a We see Man 1 answering the door. A policeman comes in.%0a%0a Policeman: "I'm arresting you on suspicion of terrorism".%0a%0a Man 1: "But I'm innocent!"%0a%0a http://www.gonadovision.homeip.net/video/identity/arrest.jpg %0a%0a The policeman leads Man 1 away in handcuffs.%0a%0a----%0a%0aAnnouncer: "Remember SITGAS. STOP IDENTITY THEFT, GET A SHREDDER."%0a%0aThe acronym is spelt down the screen in red and as the announcer says each work, the rest of the word appears next to the initial letter, in white.%0a%0aWe see Man 1 (in the same clothes as the first scene) in his house using a shredder. However, his tie is getting quite close to the opening in the shredder.%0a%0aAnnouncer: "But don't get your tie caught in it!"%0a%0aThe screen goes black and we hear a grinding, tearing noise and Man 1 saying, "Uh oh!" or something like that.%0a%0aThe end.\\%0a%0a%0a'''Props Required:'''\\\%0a%0aplastic/paper letters to spell out title\\%0a2 outfits and wigs\\%0ashredder\\%0apolice uniform\\%0afake credit card bill\\%0afake bank statement\\%0afake utility bill\\%0adustbin (use binbags instead)\\%0a\\\%0a%0a'''Cast:'''%0a||border=1 width=60%25 align=left%0a|| '''Character''' || '''Actor''' ||%0a||[[Characters/EverybodyBrian | Brian Everybody ]] ||[[Actors/BrownAlan | Alan Brown ]] ||%0a||[[Characters/Thief | The Thief ]] ||[[Actors/BawnAndrew | Andrew Bawn ]] ||%0a||[[Characters/Narrator | Narrator ]] ||[[Actors/BushellJane | Jane Bushell ]] ||||%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a'''Production:'''%0a||border=1 width=60%25 align=left%0a||Director ||[[Actors/BrownAlan | Alan Brown]] ||%0a||Cameras ||[[Actors/BawnAndrew | Andrew Bawn ]] / [[Actors/BrownAlan | Alan Brown]] ||||%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a%0a[[#Downloads]]%0a'''Downloads'''\\\%0a%0a http://www.gonadovision.homeip.net/video/identity/gtbfilms.jpg%0a\\\%0a[[http://www.gonadovision.homeip.net/video/identity/title3small.avi | Click here for an unused experimental stop-motion end-credit sequence (2.1MB)]]%0a\\\%0a[[http://www.gonadovision.homeip.net/video/identity/identity.wmv | Click here for completed version of Identity Theft, with narration and sound effects added!

He is wearing a shirt and tie and glasses.%0a%3c %0a%3c Unseen announcer: "Protect yourself from identity theft!"%0a%3c %0a%3c Man 2 walks into view. He is dressed differently to Man 1, and isn't wearing glasses. He reaches across to Man 1 and takes his glasses and puts them on himself. There is a flash and now they have instantly swapped clothing and wigs as well. Man 2 starts walking away.%0a%3c %0a%3c Announcer: "Is this identity theft?"%0a%3c %0a%3c Close-up of the faces of Man 1 and Man 2 waiting keenly for the answer to this question.%0a%3c %0a%3c Announcer: "No it isn't."%0a%3c %0a%3c Another flash, and Man 1 and Man 2 swap back to their original clothing/wigs/glasses.%0a%3c %0a%3c Announcer: "Identity theft is much worse than that."%0a%3c %0a%3c Man 1 is opening his credit card bill. There are lots of items with big figures next to them. No company names are mentioned, just things like "Betting shop £300, Off licence £100, Supermarket £200, Saucy Sues Marital Aids £350, Electrical store £1000". We hear him saying things like "What on earth?" and "I didn't spend that!".%0a%3c %0a%3c His eyes (and our camera) focus on the figure at the bottom, £5000 or whatever, and we hear a "good grief" from our man.%0a%3c %0a%3c Announcer: "How did this happen?"%0a%3c %0a%3c We see Man 1 standing inside his house, and our camera view pulls right back so that we see the garden and then the edge of the street, and then the wheely bin outside his house. %0a%3c %0a%3c Caption at bottom of screen saying "Last Week...". %0a%3c %0a%3c Man 2 is rummaging through the bin. He finds an old bank statement (again faked, maybe from "Bank Of Britain", but it looks real and has Man 1's name and address on it). There is an electricity bill as well, maybe from British Power. %0a%3c %0a%3c Man 2 runs off with them.%0a%3c %0a%3c Announcer: "With a few household bills or bank statements of yours, somebody can pretend to be you. Infact from an electronic point of view, they ARE YOU"%0a%3c %0a%3c Man 2 is holding the bills he stole, sitting in a darkened room, and his face morphs into that of Man 1, who starts laughing evilly. We could possibly use that Matrix style effect as part of the morph here.%0a%3c %0a%3c Announcer: "And the consequences might be more than financial".%0a%3c %0a%3c We see Man 1 answering the door. A policeman comes in.%0a%3c %0a%3c Policeman: "I'm arresting you on suspicion of terrorism".%0a%3c %0a%3c Man 1: "But I'm innocent!"%0a%3c %0a%3c The policeman leads Man 1 away in handcuffs.%0a%3c %0a%3c Announcer: "Remember SITGAS. STOP IDENTITY THEFT, GET A SHREDDER."%0a%3c %0a%3c The acronym is spelt down the screen in red and as the announcer says each work, the rest of the word appears next to the initial letter, in white.%0a%3c %0a%3c Not sure about this epilogue though:%0a%3c %0a%3c We see Man 1 (in the same clothes as the first scene) in his house using a shredder. However, his tie is getting quite close to the opening in the shredder.%0a%3c %0a%3c Announcer: "But don't get your tie caught in it!"%0a%3c %0a%3c The screen goes black and we hear a grinding, tearing noise and Man 1 saying, "Uh oh!" or something like that.%0a%3c %0a%3c The end.\\%0a%3c (If it is too long we can cut out the bit with the policeman)%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c '''Props Required:'''\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c plastic/paper letters to spell out title (gonad)\\%0a%3c 2 outfits and wigs (gonad)\\%0a%3c shredder\\%0a%3c police uniform (gonad)\\%0a%3c fake credit card bill (gonad)\\%0a%3c fake bank statement (gonad)\\%0a%3c fake utility bill (gonad)\\%0a%3c dustbin (use binbags instead)\\%0a%3c \\\%0a%3c %0a%3c '''Cast:'''\\\%0a%3c %0a%3c Man 1\\%0a%3c Man 2\\%0a%3c Announcer\\%0a%3c Policeman\\%0a%3c \\\%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
