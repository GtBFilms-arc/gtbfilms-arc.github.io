<h2>YAPIG Installation</h2>

<p>Follow this simple steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Modify config.php file and at least:
  <ul>
   <li>Change login user and password.</li>
   <li>Comment line with '$STOP=true' or set this variable as false. Unless
       you do this you will not be able to login and add galleries.</li>
 </ul>
</li>

<li>Upload/Copy all files and directories contained in the <i>tar.gz</i> 
package.</li>

<li>Modify directory permissions of $BASE_DIR (='photos/' as default) and
set them 777 (drwxrwxrwx)</li>

<li>Give Yapig's root directory 777 permissions.<small>(Note: some servers
even require to give 6777 permissions, such as lycos, so if you get
permissions problems with 777 try this.)</li>

<li>For each new gallery follow this steps:</li>
 <ul><li>Using an FTP Client:
      <ol>
      <li>Create a new subdirectory in $BASE_DIR (= "photos/" as default).</li>
      <li>Set permissions to 777 of that directory.</li>
      <li>Fill the ADD NEW GALLERY FORM.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Using Upload Form:
        <ol><li>Login as admin. Click on Upload</li>
	    <li>Create a new directory</li>
	    <li>Upload images on that directory</li>
	    <li>Fill the ADD NEW GALLERY FORM.</li>
	</ol>    
    </li>
 </ul>  
 </li>
</ol> 

<h4>SAFE MODE installation</h4>
<p>
Some server admin set the php safe_mode which restricts some of the actions
yapig can perform automatically. One of these limitations is the installation.
Yapig creates a random name directory during install, but with safe mode it
can not do it, so you have to make this directory manually using ftp or a
console, then give 777 permissions (for example: chmod 777 random_dir_name)
and finally complete the form of yapig the installation.

</p>
<b>Security Advice:</b> After installing YaPiG, it is heavily recommended to
delete install.php file avoiding possible bugs on that potentially dangerous 
file.
</p>

<h2>PROBLEMS DURING INSTALLATION</h2>

<p>Most of problems are related to file permissions or file access. If you
are a new YaPiG's user, I recommend to use default values at first 
(not modifying config.php, just commenting $STOP line as said above),
 and then customize YaPiG. Once you have finished your probes, do not forget
to change $USER and $PASSWORD
</p>

<h4>GD library problems</h4>
<p>YaPiG requires the GD library to work (1.6.x or above since 0.91). 
This library is a extension with some functions for handling images 
(creation, load, modify...). It is included in the standard PHP suite
but many web hosting providers disable it. YaPiG will try to load it 
automatically if available.
</p>

<p>
Possible problems related with this topic are: 
</p>

<ol>
<!-- <li><b>Your GD library is 1.x</b> If you are the server admin you must update your
gd library or your PHP version, as you prefer. If you are using a web hosting
you have two options. The first one is to change your web hosting provider to other
that has the version 2.0 of this library, and the second one is to contact your
system administrator and expose your problem.</li>
-->

<li><b>Dynamic extension load function not available.</b> If you reach this
message during installation of YaPiG this will be because your server does
not load GD library as default and YaPiG tries to load it but your server
administrator has disabled the use of this function. Again, contact him
or change your web provider. If you are using your own server, then edit
<i>php.ini</i> file and set this directive as follows: <i>enable_dl = On</i>
</li>

<li><b>GD library not loaded.</b> This problem appears when YaPiG tries to
load the GD library and it is not available on your server. The solutions,
once again, are contact your administrator or change your web provider.


<p>If you are the server admin, loading the GD library automatically when you 
start your web server is very easy. Search your <i>php.ini</i> file.
Then open it and search for this line:</p> 

<pre>
   ;extension=gd.so        <-- Linux/Unix/Mac Systems
   ;extension=php_gd2.dll  <-- Windows Systems
</pre>

<p>Then remove the ";" character and restart your web server. If this line
does not exist add it.
</p>

<p>

For more information about this directive  
<a
href="http://es2.php.net/manual/en/configuration.directives.php#ini.extension">read
the PHP manual</a>
</small>
</p>
</li>


<li><b>Warning: Could not get GD version</b> You might get this message
during installation. For having support on GD 1.6.x and GD 2.x  versions
yapig must know witch one you are using. Yapig tries to get it automatically,
but it can fail, so if this happends, after installing, edit $BASE_DIR/global-gen.php
file ($BASE_DIR='photos/' as default), search and set the variable called 
<code>$GD_VERSION=1;</code> if you are using 1.x GD library or
$GD_VERSION=2; if you have the 2.x library.  
</li>
</ol>


<h4>Other Problems</h4>

<ol>
<li><b>Headers Already Sent</b> Maybe after you modified YaPiG config file,
you get a message like this:</p>
<pre>
Warning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output
started at
/home/www/htdocs/gallery/config.php:228) in
/home/www/htdocs/gallery/view.php on line 72
</pre>
<p>This is caused because there must not be any  any character (visible or
invisible) before "&lt;?php" and after "?&gt;" in config.php (in other
functions files as functions.php, view_func.php,etc.. is the same)
</p>

<li>
<p><b>Extension Path Problems</b> In some rare cases php extensions might
not be correctly configured by default. If
this happends you might get this error running YaPiG:
</p>
<pre>
    Unknown(): unable to load dynamic library './php_gd2.dll' - The specified
    module could not be found.
</pre>
<p>If this occurs, search the file php_gd2.dll (on Unix/Mac the file is
called gd.so) and then on your <i>php.ini</i> change this directive to the
correct value:</p>
<pre>
  ; Directory in which the loadable extensions (modules) reside.
  extension_dir = ./extensions/
  ; This path is relative to php.exe on windows systems.
</pre>
</li>
</ol>

<p>If you have any other problem during installation of using YaPiG,
please  read <a href="FAQ.html">FAQ documentation</a>.  If your problem 
is not contempled there go to 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=93674">YaPiG's forums</a>.
Before posting check if any other user had the same problem, and please
include your operating system and yapig version. Thank you.
</p>

<h4>Reinstalling</h4>

<p>During YaPig installation it is created a file called <i>global-gen.php</i>
on YaPiG's $BASE_DIR (='photos/' as default) directory (the value is set on
<i>config.php</i>). For reinstalling, just delete this file.
Obviously, if you do this you will need to create all galleries you have
again. If you are having problems during first installation, sometimes is better
to start from scratch.</p>


<h4>Upgrading</h4>

<p>Upgrading from a version to other it is not automatically done, so you have
to do it manually and some versions are incompatible with others. All 0.8x are
compatible. A simple way to upgrade yapig is replace all source files
included in the yapig package except config.php. In these versions the template
has not been modified (only for repairing little minor bugs) so if you modified 
them don't worry, you won't lost this work, because is not neccessary to 
replace these files.
