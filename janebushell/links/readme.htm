<p>DESCRIPTION</p>

<p>PHP link manager will completely automate your reciprocal links exchange!</p>

<hr>

<p>Requirements</p>

<ul>
	<li>UNIX or Windows server (it *might* work on others too)</li>
    <li>PHP 4.3.x support</li>
    <li>FTP access and a FTP program</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><b>&gt;&gt; Quick installation</b></p>

<p>Open file settings.php in your favorite <b>PLAIN TEXT</b> editor (like Notepad or
Wordpad on Windows systems, DO NOT use MS Word or similar editor) and set these variables:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>$settings['system']</b> - set to 1 if your website is on a server under Linux (most servers are),
set to 2 if it is under Windows (your SERVER, not your computer!). If you are not
sure which operating system your server runs under
try with $settings['system'] set to 1 first or consult your web hosting company.
If you are under some other OS (not Linux nor Win)
you can try setting it from 1 to 3 and see if it works<br><br></li>
<li><b>$settings['apass']</b> - this will be your password for the admin panel. Change it from the
default password <b>admin</b>. Use only letters a-Z, A-Z and numbers 0-9<br><br></li>
<li><b>$settings['site_url']</b> - URL of your website. This is the URL your link
partners will have to place on their website.<br><br></li>
<li><b>$settings['admin_email']</b> - Your e-mail address.<br><br></li>
<li><b>$settings['notify']</b> - If set to <b>1</b> you will receive an e-mail notification
at the above e-mail address every time someone successfully submits a link. Set
to <b>0</b> if you don't want to be notified.<br><br></li>
<li><b>$settings['max_links']</b> - Set to the maximum links you will allow submitted.
For better performance please set an appropriate limit (50 works fine on most servers).
Once this limit is reached no new links can be submitted (unless some are deleted)<br><br></li>
<li><b>$settings['clean']</b> - If set to <b>1</b> the &quot;straight&quot; URLs
will appear as links (example: http://www.somesite.com). If set to <b>0</b> redirects
will be used<br>(example: http://www.yourdomain.com/linkman/go.php?url=http://www.somesite.com).<br><br></li>
<li><b>$settings['add_to']</b> - If set to <b>0</b> new listings will appear to
the top of the page. If you want new listings to appear below old listings
set this variable to <b>1</b>.<br><br></li>
<li><b>$settings['linkfile']</b> - File where all the link data will be stored
(advanced users only).
You may leave this as it is.<br><br></li>
</ul>

<p>Save and close the settings.php file.</p>

<p>Go to your FTP client and FTP to the public
directory on your server (where the rest
of your website is; usually &quot;public_html&quot;, &quot;www&quot; or &quot;site&quot;)
and create a folder where you will install linkman.<br>
Example: /public_html/linkman<br>
Corresponding URL: http://www.yourdomain.com/linkman</p>

<p>Upload all LinkMan files to this folder. Images (line.gif,reset.gif,delete.gif)
must be transferred in BINARY mode, other files in ASCII mode (refer to your FTP client
instructions for details on how to set transfer mode properly).</p>

<p>Make sure that the PHP scripts have permission to write to file linkinfo.txt
- on UNIX (Linux) servers you must CHMOD (set permissions for) this
file to 666 (rw-rw-rw).</p>

<p>Use the HTML form from &quot;form.html&quot; to allow users to submit their links.
YOu may modify the look of this page as much as you like or even use the form
HTML code on any page you like, just make sure you set the proper ACTION parameter
of the &lt;form ... &gt; tag!</p>

<p>The links.php file is the one that displays all the links. Use this file as
your links page, for example use page http://www.yourdomain.com/linkman/links.php
as your &quot;Reciprocal links&quot; page.</p>

<p>You may edit header.txt and footer.txt files to add your own header and footer
to the links page. You will have to use <b>full image URLs</b> in the code. For example
instead of &lt;IMG SRC=&quot;images/image.jpg&quot; ... &gt; use
&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;http://www.yourdomain.com/images/image.jpg&quot; ... &gt;! Same
goes for any Javascripts or CSS files if you are calling them from within the
header or footer.</p>

<p>If you have done all this your link exchange should work now. In your browser open
folder where you have installed LinkMan, for example:<br>
http://www.yourdomain.com/linkman</p>

<p>Type in the password you set in settings.php, click Enter admin panel and you
are in the admin panel! Here you can remove unwanted links and run a check to see
if sites still have your reciprocal link.</p>

<p>Good luck with the script!</p>

<hr>

<p><b>&gt;&gt; Troubleshooting</b></p>

<p><b>What is CHMOD and FTP?</b></p>

<p>I have prepared a simple <a href="http://www.phpjunkyard.com/ftp-chmod-tutorial.php" target="_blank">
FTP and CHMOD tutorial</a> which will help you FTP files to your server and
set correct CHMOD settings.</p>

<p><b>My link exchange doesn't work, HELP!</b></p>

<p>Here are a few things to check:</p>
<ol>
<li>did you upload all files except images in ASCII mode?</li>
<li>is linkinfo.txt file world writable? CHMOD it to 666 (rw-rw-rw) if you are on a UNIX server</li>
<li>go through the entire setup process again carefully</li>
</ol>

<p>Since these scripts are free no support is guaranteed. If you can't get the script to work please go
through this readme file again carefully and repeat the installation step-by-step (also delete old
files and folders from the server). Also please feel free to post any questions or problems you might have
in <a href="http://developers.phpjunkyard.com">PHPJunkyard forum</a>!</p>

<p>That's it! If you use PHPJunkYard free scripts or any portion of their code  please place a link
to PHPJunkYard.com on your website. I won't sue you if you don't, but
I believe it is a fair trade for a free script/code. Think about it. You can
