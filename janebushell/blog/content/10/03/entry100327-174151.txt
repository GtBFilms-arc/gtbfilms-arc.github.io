VERSION|0.5.1|SUBJECT|Coming Soon|CONTENT|In September 2007 I moved to Edinburgh and from time to time have visitors who need entertaining. Therefore I am always looking for interesting/fun places to take them.  The purpose of this blog is to review these attractions in order to help readers visiting Edinburgh decide what to do.  Come back soon as I hope to start writing very soon.  PS - If this message is 2 years old sorry!  Jane|CATEGORIES|1|IP-ADDRESS|188.221.67.230|DATE|1269711711|CREATEDBY|janeb
