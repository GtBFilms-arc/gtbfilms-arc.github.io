YAPIG - Yet Another PHP Image Gallery (Distributed under GPL)
-------------------------------------------------------------
YAPIG is a simple PHP script that allows you to publish your favourite
images and photos ordered in galleries.  It counts visitors of each gallery
and each image. Visitors can make comments of each picture. It is great
to publish your digital photos of events like parties, trips, crazy nights, 
etc.

Requirements
------------
    * Webserver with PHP 4 with GD library
    * Nice pictures

Stable or Unstable Version
--------------------------
Stable: This version has less features but the probability to have bugs
        is minor.
	
Unstable: This version has the latest features, but they can be still being
          developed or released for users to test them and report bugs.
	  
¿What version should I use?
      Well, if you want to publish a gallery you should use the stable one,
but if you want to help the project or see what will be in future stable
releases you can check the unstable version. 

The biggest difference between them is that the unstable version has been 
tested only by me and only in my system. When an unstable
version has been tested and the bugs seem to be repaired it is changed to
stable. Althought, when it is stable then appear more bugs because it is
more widely used.
