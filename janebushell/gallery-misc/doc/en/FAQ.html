<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>



<h3>About Yapig itself</h3>

<dt><b>For what should I use Yapig?</b></dt>
<dd>Yapig is specially thought to people that wants to publish some images, 
pictures, photos on the internet. Using Yapig you have a very simple to use
system that helps you to create the thumbnails and administrate your
galleries. For example, if you have a digital camera and you want to show
your shots to the world, Yapig will help you!</dd>

<dt><b>What does require Yapig?</b></dt>
<dd>
Yapig requires a web server that supports <a
href="http://www.php.net">PHP 4.x</a> witch is a programming language mainly
oriented to web developing. Most of web hostings support this language, it
is very popular on the internet. As well, requires that your server has the
GD lybrary, witch is an extension included in the standard distribution of
PHP that has some functions for handling images.
</dd>

<dt><b>Does it support GD 1.6 version?</b></dt>
<dd>YES, since 0.91-1 version or higher. Of course GD 2.0 works as well</dd>

<dt><b>I would like to customize Yapig look, is it possible?</b></dt>
<dd>
Yes, of course, yapig uses a template system, that is, you don't have to edit
the PHP source code to change the look, you can easilly edit the HTML of the
templates. As well, Yapig look relies in Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
</dd>

<dt><b>Does Yapig show the JPEG EXIF information</b></dt>
<dd>
Most of Digital cameras create JPEG files with some extra information about
the picture in a common format called EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format).
Since version 0.94u Yapig displays some EXIF info.
</dd>

<dt><b>Why does not Yapig use SQL databases?</b></dt>
<dd>
 The idea is to create a script that requires minimal server requirements,
so it can work in nearly all php enabled servers. Many
 servers offer free php service but paid SQL access. Maybe
 in the future there will be the option of using text and SQL data bases. 
</dd>

<dt><b>Why does not use Smarty for templates?</b></dt>
<dd>
Once again, simplicity. Smarty is very powerful, but requires a 'big' effort
for users learning it. Yapig's template system is very easy to use and you 
can integrate Yapig in your web with minimal effort thanks to it only
needing a little of HTML or CSS knowledge
</dd>

<dt><b>I like this project, how can I help it?</b></dt>
<dd>There are several ways to help this project: 

<ul>
<li>Developing
Yapig source code or 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=605078&group_id=93674&func=browse">sending patches</a> 
or improvements. Some people already sent
them and have been included in Yapig's releases. Yapig source code is
heavily documented and I think it is quite easy to modify.
</li>
<li>Other way to help the
project is sending bugs, if when you are using Yapig you find that there is
something that does not work as it was espected you can report that problem.
You can also post 
<a
href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=605079&group_id=93674&func=browse">new
features</a> you would like tol have on future releases or give your
preferences for the already sent ones.</li>
<li>Translating or updating Yapig's translations. Yapig is translated into
some languages, but these translations need to be updated from time to time 
to support new features output text. How to translate or update Yapig's
translation is explained in <a href="doc/translations.html">translations docs</a></li>

<li>Finally, one of the easiest way
to help the project, if you find it interesting, is helping other users to
find it. Yapig is indexed on some resource pages, this pages rank the
programs they have or let users post their opinion. Your task is simple, you
just have to vote or write an opinion about Yapig on these webs. Just tell
other users why you chose Yapig, what are the advantages/disadvantages and
what you like or don't like about it, that is, what you think about this
program. To find Yapig, you can use the search engine most of this pages have.

<dt><b>Why do you develop Yapig</b></dt>
<dd>Well, I bought a Digital Camera and I searched for a nice script for
publishing my personal albums, I didn't find any that matched what exactly 
I wanted so I decided to develop mine's one :D. I wanted it to be very simple, 
lightweight and easy to customize. As well, I've made a big effort on user documentation
and internationalization issues on the script, that is something I
appreciate when I use some kind of software. I hate good software witch is
poorly documented because I can't use it if there is any problem! </dd>

<h3>Installation</h3>


<dl>
<dt><b>Web host where Yapig works</b></dt>
<dd>On <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1020974&forum_id=323824">Yapig's
forum</a>, it  was created a thread where users can post witch web
server can run Yapig. So if you are searching a webhost or you know a good
one: share your knowledge!  </dd>

<dt><b>Could not create index.html</b></dt>
<dd> As default Yapig creates a file called <i>index.html</i>, this is done
to avoid default HTTP server file listing. There are two critical
directories $BASE_DIR (defined in config.php) and $SECURE_DIR (defined in
$BASE_DIR/global_gen.php). If you have password protected
galleries you MUST create a blank <i>index.html</i> file for security
reasons in both dirs. If you don't have password protected files, it doesn't
matter.
</dd>

<dt><b>Permissions Issues</b></dt>
<dd>Most of problems running <b>Yapig</b> are related to permissions. Remember:
<ul>
<li><b>photos/</b> directory must have 777 (drwxrwrwx) permissions</li>
<li>Each <b>gallery directory</b> must have 777 (drwxrwxrwx) permissions</li>
<li>Yapig's root directory must have 777 permissions as well.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><b>What does give 777 permissions mean?</b></dt>
<dd>
It is a commonly used terminology on Unix/Linux operating systems, this only
means that you have to give all read, write and execution permissions to
this folder for the owner of the folder, the group of the owner of the
folder and other users that are out the owner group. This is necessary
because on most system the user who runs the webserver and executes the
Yapig script is different from the owner of the files, and must have access
to write on them (for example, to store a comment)<br />
To change these permissions on most ftp clients you have the option, just
search for: modify permissions, modify atributes, chmod or something.<br />
If you are accesing using a shell of text based client the command is <i>chmod
777 filename</i>. For more information you can search in your favourite
search engine <i>unix file permissions</i>.
</dd>

<h3>Running</h3>
<dl>
<dt><b>Yapig Excedes execution time</b></dt>
<dd>This is because as default PHP runs its scripts during 30 seconds. After
that time, it kills them. You have to edit your <i>php.ini</i> file and modify this value to:<pre>
     max_execution_time = 300     ; Maximum execution time of each script, in seconds
</pre>
From 0.94 and above Yapig tries to do this automatically, but some servers
disallow changing the maximun execution time.
</dd>

<dt><b>Memory problems with big images</b></dt>
<dd>
 If you are trying to create a gallery with images whitch size in pixels is
very big, it might cause problems when running Yapig. On php server config
(<i>php.ini</i>) there is a directive that sets the maximun amount of memory
allocable by a single script, set to 8MB as default. When Yapig loads big
images and tries to allocate more than this amount, the PHP engine returns a
Fatal Error. The possible solutions to this are:
<ul>
<li>change php.ini directive <i>memory_limit = 16M</i>, for example.</li>
<li>Reduce the image size.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt><b></b></dt>
<dd>
</dd>

<!--
<dt><b></b></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
-->
<dt><b>How does password protect the images?</b></dt>
<dd>Yapig gallery password system is very insecure because if you know the 
directory and the image name you can access directly to the image url with 
your browser.
Anyway, for personal albums it is enought and if you choose rare/random 
image names it will be enougth. In the future, it will be studied 
how to improve this security topic.
