Yapig TODO List
---------------

What is missing until version 1.0.0?

1. Multilevel galleries: This will allow having a hierarchy on the gallery
2. Allow having big galleries without the use of set_max_execution_time. Now 
   to create big galleries it is necessary to call this function, not always
   available on public servers.
   
3. Watermarking: Make an automatic mark on the images to add some kind of
   copyright.
4. Dynamic gallery creation: Upload files and automatically create the 
5. Help system: Put links on the forms with help text. 

What will be next?

1. PHP5 + Object oriented programming
2. SQL support
3. Multiuser support.
