before i answer your questions, i would like to know what 
address you responded to and where you got it. There is 
no problem, if you responded to a mail you received
from me, i do not believe the address you responded to 
was the reply to address.

i am just curious where you got my program, was it in a 
newsgroup or in your inbox.also did you respond to me 
from a different address so i know for my records?

sorry for the inconvenience. i will answer your questions 
as soon as i hear from you. yes the program is real..
