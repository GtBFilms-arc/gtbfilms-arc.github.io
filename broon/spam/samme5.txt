From: Big Al 

I am sorry if he has been emailing you, I was not aware that he was   
 being abusive. I shall email him and ask him to stop it.

Did you get my last email about the addresses to send the $20 to, I am
not sure if my email is working right. Anyway, Mike said you had
emailed him with a different address:

> [address removed, see later explanation]

have I to send the money to this guy who deals with the cash-flow, or
the address on the original letter:

Eaglehead Productions
C/O 10 Berwyn Hall
English Village Apartments
Newark, Delaware 19711

which one is it? (I take it Mike is definately not taking part anymore
then, so I will not email him a copy of the letter)     

Sorry about his behaviour,

Al
