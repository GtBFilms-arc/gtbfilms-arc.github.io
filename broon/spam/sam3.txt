the best i can tell you is when i mailed for the reports, i wasn't
sure i was going to get them, but i did. that gave me some assurance
that the program actually existed.  as for how much have i made, i
just started doing it about two weeks ago. it takes time to get email
addresses. i can tell you that i have spoken to the person i sent to
for one of the reports and he has made a few thousand $ already. I
also spoke to someone else that happened to send me the same program
and they too made a few thousand so far.  i am just at the beginning
stages.  i am not sure what you mean when you say do i add all the
names at the same time. i think the answer you want is NO. you just
move the first name from the list down to number two and put yours
there at number one. then the next person to use that mail sends it
with your name second, not first. if you take the time to read the
program, you will see that it is impossible to not make money. I am an
MBA graduate in finance. i read this thing 10 times over before i
considered it, then i said why not, for $20, what the hell. If you and
your friends are serious about doing it, i suggest you all do it
separately, that way you can each make your own wealth.

the whole reason for the reports is so everyone is using the same
ones. if you changed the reports, then you would not be following the
program and you dont really understand the process. if you do this ,
every person you email it too will be sending to me for report #2. how
will i send them your different report if i dont have it and the same
goes for the person at #3 and #4, do you understand.
