You're not very bright at all, are you Harry? I stumbled upon a website 
which has an entire section dedicated to *you* and your ridiculous 
argument with a bloke going by the name of 'Big Al'. All your E-mails 
have been faithfully reproduced on his website and it makes you look 
*really* stupid!!

So dumb, in fact, I couldn't resist emailing you to let you know. I 
almost wet myself with laughter when I read some of your comments! Like:

> do you know where Texas is, WRONG, its not part of the US anymore, 
> it is now an independent Republic on its own. i see you are also
> weak on world geography as well.

What does this have to do with your line of argument?

> AS FOR THIS, YOU ARE WAY OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE ON THIS ONE BUDDY AS A
> MATTER OF FACT I DONT REMEMBER POSTING THIS ONE BUT I DO REMEMBER

> MY MOUTH TWICE, IT SUGGESTS THAT YOU ARE A VERY BAD LAWYER IN FACT
> ,SINCE IT APPEARS THAT YOU WOULD DO THE SAME IN THE COURT ROOM. THAT
> IS LEADING THE WITNESS AND ALSO ILLEGAL.

Apart from your punctuation and grammar being *way* out past Uranus 
(sic) as far as convention is concerned, you totally missed the point 
that 'Mike' was making, which was; you replied to an MML 'spam' in a 
negative manner ("has anyone even responded to your crazy busniess. if 
not , stop wasting our space" - wrote Harry Jones - aka Sam 'lagerhed' 
Adams), then you go and 'spam' in a similar manner yet expect a positive 
response by way of an abundance of five dollar bills dropping through 
your letterbox!

Your comments regarding the law also displayed your abundant ignorance. 
When 'Mike' asked you about your (lack of) legal qualifications you 
decided to spout about, "As a matter of fact i had a minor in law and i 
have 2 MBA''s in finance and economics". Qualifications which you either 
don't posses or you acquired from a public toilet paper holder.

You go on to comment on US law but have you considered the legal 
ramifications of your actions in other countries? Believe it or not, 
*you* are legally responsible for your postings which may be accessed by 
anyone in any country in the world. The type of 'get-rich-quick' scheme 
which you are proposing is, most definitely, illegal in many countries 
of the world. Ergo, you *have* just broken many national and 
international laws in one, ham-fisted, fell-swoop! Congrats!

Furthermore, you fouled up yet again...

>>     You have already broken the law anyway, if as you say, you used
>>     the internet for advertising. I refer you to:
>>     US Code Title 47, Sec.227(b)(1)(C): 

by replying:

> the law you have given is for unsolicited mail or advertisement.

Yet the email you originally sent *was* unsolicited. Nobody contacted 
you and asked, "Could you send me details of your doomed-to-failure 
plan?". So, despite your 2 MBAs and a minor in law, you fail to notice 
the multitude of laws you have flaunted! I guess it just goes to show 
that US universities are still the toilet-seats of learning they've 
always been. Flush the bog, lean over and select your chosen 
qualification from the holder to your right.

Have a nice day!
