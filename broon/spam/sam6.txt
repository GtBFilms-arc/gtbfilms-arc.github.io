please explain why the bank would write you a check for $5 american
for only 30p but it would costyou $8 to do a cash conversion. that
makes no sense. if you absolutely must send a check, make it out to H.
Jones. please explain the above situation before yo mail anything. he
is the one that cashes the checks for the company.
