i read all of the laws you included in your letter. They are all very
impressive but do not pertain to this matter.i did not write the
letter, i am merely using it as suggested by the person who originated
it. This is not a lottery. I am selling reports that have further
information on them individually on how to legitimately make money.a
lottery is a game of chance. there is no game or any risk or chance,
your will get a report telling you how to make money advertising on
the internet and other ways.  This is not a chain letter because you
decide what to do with the reports after you receive them.  a chain
letter forces you to continue the chain. no one has to do any mailing
of these reports or even of the original letter if they do not want
to. therefore there is no chain.  i am selling reports about making
money, not just asking for money by itself. if i said mail me $5 and
then said too bad sucker, that is a scheme, scam, chain letter. this
is a legitimate business. this is not fraud by any means. i suppose
you feel that infomercials are also illegal and fraudulent.  please
feel free to call the networks and let them know that you have
contacted the IRS about their commercials. the only difference from
those to mine is that mine is through email because i cant afford
$50000 per half hour of TV. if you would like to explain your position
further, i will be happy to read it.
