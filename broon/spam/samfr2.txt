Thankyou very much for you email. I send $5 about a week ago 
to Blackthorn Solutions, P.O. Box 1377, Bathgate Wells, Washington 
D.C. to get the reports.

I am thinking perhaps he got the reports from another on the list 
and not you. Do you understand? Like me who sent to him for the 
reports, I did not send to others, becase I can make many copies 
with ease.

If you want report, please email me, I email 
<terry_blackthorn@hotmail.com> - that is why it is a chain.

Please make note of which report you reqire.

Thankyou

Francine
