dont worry about the questions,im glad to answer them. i am confused
with one of your statements below. could you explain what this
means:"I can get them from the bank for about 30p each ($0.20) rather
than have to pay 8 pounds each ($5) on top of the cost of the
Reports...  what do you mean on top of the cost of the reports. each
report costs $5.  does that mean rather than pay an extra $3 for each
report, the bank will write a check for $5 in American dollars for
only $.20... if it is in american $5 dollars, my bank said it should
be no problem. they cant cash it if it is not in american dollars. all
of your friends need to each send to me for report #1, do you
understand why. that is how the program becomes sucessful. This is a
concern i just thought of for you, each of you have to mail to me for
report #1.  i am aware of this check thing. the other people on the
list are not aware of it, i am not sure they will know what to do with
it and may not send you the reports. on the other hand, they may know
exactly what to do with it and you will have no problem.
 Personally i would take the chance with sending everyone the check
 for $5
american dollars and send a small message with it explaining why you
sent that and not cash.   ALSO, do you understand what you  and your
friends need to do now with the letter i sent you. you have to put
your name at report #1 and move my name down to report #2. the person
in report #4 gets bumped off the list. they are probably sitting back
relaxing now if the program did what it says.
