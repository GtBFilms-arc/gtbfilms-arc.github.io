whats up. I need you to do me a favor. Change the name of the 
company on your list from Eaglehead productions to Dunlap 
Marketing. the address is the same. there is some jerkoff 
lawyer in england that i sold a program to one of his friends.

since he is a lawyer, he is trying to ruin my advertising with 
people that use my address on the newsgroups. I ask you to please 
limit or dont advertise on the newsgroups, as this ass has too 
much time and is looking for all with my address on it. He is
soooo stupid, that he picked a persons address that lives 5 
miles from me and has the same name. I have spoken to that 
guy too. 

anyway, i will think about sending to you for the reports, 
who made them and what are they about. did you change the 
entire letter. if you did , then i will join with you on this. 

You said you had 50 responses so far, where did you get the
addresses from. also what bulk email program are you using. 
mine works but it shows my ISP in the header.

thanks
