A friend passed on your Chain Letter Scam to me for analysis, and I
have to say that this scheme is illegal. I am a professional lawyer
and I have researched this subject after seeing your scheme, and I
have enclosed the legislation regarding your system.

Unless you want to end up in jail, stop trying to lure people into
your scheme. 

(I have also sent a copy of your letter to the IRS)

Yours,

Mike.
