Subject: Re: (no subject)

this is my last response since you are not only becoming 
too nosey in my life, but you are now PUTTING FUCKING WORDS 
IN MY MOUTH ONCE AGAIN.

 it is none of your business where i live or received my 
education, it was at two major universities in the US to keep 
privacy in my life. the study of world geography is not an 
interest of mine. do you know where Texas is, WRONG,
its not part of the US anymore, it is now an independent Republic 
on its own.
i see you are also weak on world geography as well.

>Do you have an opinion on murder, genocide, rape - ever seen it?
yes i have an opinion, they all need two people to happen.

> Well this proves that you are poorly educated, Lithuania is not 
>a 'Third World' country, it is a part of the former Soviet Union! 
>Are you at Junior High by any chance?

no but i guess you are since you dont know where Texas is?

newsgroups are for postings. anything can be posted on a newsgroup, 
thats why they are public. I see that you are losing some fire. 
not only is it in a MLM newsgroup, but there are also many others 
very similar to mine in that group, please take the time to look.

no it is not targeted mailing, that is why it was done in a news 
group. people who look in newsgroup express their ideas and 
opinions. that is what i did.

please pick any newsgroup in the entire web and show me where 
every singel message is focused on that esact topic. and unless 
it is a group that only has t members and 1 posting per week, 
you will not find any. there is a good way for you to make money, 
go to all the newsgroups in the world, find every message
that is not targeted, and take a stand for your position.

> Finally you may remember posting this:

do you see the re: in front of the subject, it stands for response. 
you are becoming less of a challenge each time you write.AS FOR 
THIS, YOU ARE WAY OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE ON THIS ONE BUDDY    

AS A MATTER OF FACT I DONT REMEMBER POSTING THIS ONE BUT I DO 
REMEMBER RESPONDING TO IT , SINCE NOT ONLY IS MY NAME NOT JOE
BELMONT AS THE POSTING AND YOUR RESPONSE HAVE INCLUDED TO PROVE 
ME RIGHT, BUT I DID RESPOND TO IT WITH MY OPINION THAT YOU 
OBVIOUSLY CANT TELL WHICH IS MINE AND WHICH IS THE ORIGINAL 
POSTING. SINCE YOU HAVE PUT WORDS IN MY MOUTH TWICE, IT SUGGESTS 
THAT YOU ARE A VERY BAD LAWYER IN FACT ,SINCE IT APPEARS THAT
YOU WOULD DO THE SAME IN THE COURT ROOM. THAT IS LEADING THE 
WITNESS AND ALSO ILLEGAL.
