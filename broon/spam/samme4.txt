Sorry to keep bothering you, but I went to the bank this lunchtime to
get the money for the reports, and they gave me 20 dollars in 2 ten
dollar notes. I asked them to give me four five dollar notes, but they
said that they don;t do them, they don;t do coins either, the lowest
they would do was ten dollars. I also had to pay 8 pounds to get them
in comission so I am not very happy.

Anyway, how the hell am I going to be able to send 5 dollars to all
the people on the list if the lowest I can get is 10 dollar notes?

Can I send you 20 dollars, and then you send me all the reports 1,2,3
and 4 or something?

I am sorry about all this trouble, the Banks here seem to be stuck in
the dark ages or something. I mean they must have U.S. cash coming in
all the time with tourists and stuff, so I do not know what they do
with all the smaller notes and coins, but they will not sell them,
bastards.

Anyway, let me know if I can send you the 20 and get the reports, then
at last I can get on with making some money!

Thanks,

Al
