I have now considered your message, and I concede I may have made 
a mistake. Please pass on my apologies to the other Harry Jones. 
Assure him that I will be emailling everyone I contacted to tell 
them to remove his address from the list. Also please apologise 
for your own actions which dragged him into the picture in 
the first place, tell him about your cheme and see what he says.

I will be immediately telling everyone I contacted, and posting 
to the groups I posted to, to tell them all that the new address 
is:

[Compuserve demanded this address be removed
despite the fact he gives it on his SPAM mail
To find it yourself, go to Four11.com
and type in his street, city and state (from the
original spam included above - he is #1) - it will
give the name at the address and phone number]


And when contacting this address/phone number to state that 
Harry Jones has been posting this information on the net, 
and to people he does not know. I apologise for any inconvenience.

Who is [Removed by Compuserve] then? Still live with your mum eh?

Mike
