this may be a dumb question, but if you are selling all of the 
reports for $5, then why do you have other people on the list. 
I am not sure i understand how you have changed the program. 

i realize you changed the reports,but if you had 50 requests
and my name was on the list, shouldnt i have had 50 requests. 
please explain how you are doing this. You are correct, it 
sounds like a better idea what you are doing but i would like 
to understand it so i can do it with you and not against you.

can you send me a copy of what you are sending out that has 
gotten 50 requests.

thanks-
