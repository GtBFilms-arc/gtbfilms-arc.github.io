Since you are not capable of stopping your senseless arguments, 
i will stop for you.
Regardless of what last years directory says or what you think, 
the new phonebook for 97-98 has [Removed] at a 
new address with your phone number.  
It is not her address that you are using, it is Eaglehead 
Productions address. 

I am sorry that you cannot get that through your simple mind. 
You can continue to spread that address with that name and 
address if you like, but i am sure sooner or later, you will 
be hearing from [Removed] about spreading 
her NAME and NUMBER just as you did for Harry at 
[Removed]. she will not care  about the address 
as i have already told you, she has not lived here in two
years.

>As the last known resident at that address her information 
>is still valid.

that is the stupidest thing i have ever heard in my entire life 
on this planet.
you ARE dumber than i thought. you were actually beginning to 
impress me, but that ruined it for you. What you meant to say 
was the last known listed resident. its not my fault that 
[Removed] chose to have her name listed, i did 
not.

And before you start the ridiculous arguement of why a 
business is not listed in the phone book, it is because it is 
an internet based business. there would be no benefit of having 
it in the phone book.

thank you for continuing to advertise the program for me and 
have a great day!!!
