I have spoken to the Harry Jones that lives at [removed]. He 
is very upset that his address is being spread around the internet 
as i have shown him with your name attached to it. If you would 
like, i will get a hand written note from him explaining that he 
is going to call the police if it does not stop. If you do not 
believe me, then you are a fool.Call him since you have his 
number and ask him.
