I do not know why this is, I went into the bank here and asked how
much for American dollars, and they said there was a minimum charge
for converting currency of 10% or $5 dollars, whichever is the
smaller. The minimum charge on cheques was 30p. I do not know why this
is, but I think I got confused, as it will not cost me $5 for each $5
note, but $5 in total (for 4 x $5=$20) - so that is not as expensive
as I was thinking.

I will get the money this afternoon, and send it to the people on the
list. I do not know how long it will take to reach you, but it should
only be a few days. Do you have a copy of the reports ready to send
out?

                      [AT THIS POINT I WAS GETTING BORED WITH IT, 
                       SO I INTRODUCED ANOTHER CHARACTER TO TRY TO 
                       UPSET HIM. - MIKE_Z_THORNTON IS A THROWAWAY
                       ACCOUNT - HE IS APPARENTLY A LEGAL EXPERT]

I don't know if you remember but I have a friend who is a lawyer. He
is no longer going to be participating in the system because he says
he is not sure about the legality - I am a little worried about what
he says, as I do not want to get in trouble with the law again. Maybe
you could take a look at what he emailled me, let me know if he is
talking bullshit or not - here is his email:
