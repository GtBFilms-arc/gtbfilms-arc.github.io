What? I probably know more about Texas than you! You are 3 bricks 
short of the full load mate!

>yes i have an opinion, they all need two people to happen.

Whereas your scheme requires the invasion of privacy of thousands 
- your point is?

>no but i guess you are since you dont know where Texas is?

What the hell has Texas to do with anything?

Oh right, you only did it 'because everyone else was doing it' - do 
everyone a favour, hang out with intravenous drug users for a while 
Harry.

Ever heard of off-topic postings? No, I thought not.

The sad state of usenet is indeed something to be angry about. 
However it was a damn sight better before sad lamers like you 
got access to the net.

I could certainly run rings round you. By the way, your 
CAPS LOCK key seems to be jammed.

I am fully aware of who wrote what here, my point, which you 
seem to have missed, is that you seem to think it is okay 
for you to advertise your crazy business on the net, but 
not for anyone else. You feel that Joe was 'wasting space', 
even though his business is probably on the right side of the 
law, unlike yours. You are either a hypocrite or extremely 
retarded.

>ENOUGH TO KEEP GOING mike.

But not enough to stop right?

Come on be honest, Al is the only person you have convinced, 
and he suffers from a terrible case of optimism. You should 
be ashamed of yourself taking advantage of someone who has 
a record of gambling debts and problems.

Huh, run out of answers more like.... By the way, press the 
CAPS LOCK key once to switch it off again...
