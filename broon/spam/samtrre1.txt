Who are you and why are you screwing with this program. You mailed 
out a copy of the letter with my name as #2 and someone else 
mailed it out with my name as #3.

Neither of you mailed to me for any of the reports. DID you READ 
the program or are
you that dumb. you mail to each person for one report. By 
having Francine mail to you for all the reports does not help 
anyoner elso on the list. Are you dumb or just ignorant?
