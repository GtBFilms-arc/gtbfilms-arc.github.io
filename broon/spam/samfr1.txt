Hi Sam,  I am thanking you for email, I did not find it offensive 
do not be afraid!

I saw the note on news, I was reading some news and I reply to 
the sender who I send $5. He send the reports to me in message 
and so I continue the chain.

It is no problem. If you would like a report it is a simple task 
to send $5 to me and I will email you whichever report you would 
be like.

Please exscuse, I am learning English langage only now!!
