Who the hell are you?

Hey, I never mailed anyone for a report. It's none of your 
business but I started up the list again - a NEW list, with 
reports written by me. I never thought I'd get much response 
at first so I wasn't wasting $20. I was wrong, I've had 
about 50 requests so far, so I thought "what the hell" and 
wrote up my own version  of the reports.

There is no law against that. You are lucky I left you on 
the list. This is an all-new list and you are on it for FREE. 
So don't give me any shit, or I'll just email everyone who 
responded and get them to take you off it, and you will 
get FUCK ALL.

I cannot remember who I gave what to, but I did give some 
of the people who repsonded later all of the reports for $5, 
they were only a page each so I gave them a better deal - 
my loss, I could have made $20 out of them for all four if 
I wanted, it has nothing to do with you. If I choose to give 
people a better deal then that's not your problem, that's 
business. 

My business gives a better deal than everyone else, so I 
get the customers.

Get real buddy.
