Dear Harry,

             Thanks for relying so promptly to my email and answering
my questions, I showed your email to my friends and they agreed that
you were right about the Reports and doing it individually. Now I
can't lose, as I am going to sign up 5 of my friends into the
scheme, and that will pay for my expenditure! I can only profit
after that!

Unfortunately, it is not so easy to get hold of $5 notes here in the
U.K.  - it will cost me almost double to get them, so I was
thinking, would an international cheque be okay? I can get them from
the bank for about 30p each ($0.20) rather than have to pay 8 pounds
each ($5) on top of the cost of the Reports... If this is okay, let
me know and I will send them tomorrow.

Sorry for all the questions, many thanks for your time...
Al
