Okay, this is a business after all! We can all make 
money.

I have been thinking, you will be selling different 
reports to me, and as yours are multi-generation 
Xerox copies, the quality will be low. If you want to 
send $5 to my address, I could send you all 4 of the 
NEW reports by email.

This would make everyone selling the same items. The 
address to send the $5 to is:

Blackthorn Solutions
P.O. Box 1377
Bathgate Wells
Washington D.C.

Thanks, remember, on this new system, you can sell as many 
or as few reports as you want, for the price you want, 
it's up to you!

Thanks,

Terry
