Subject: Does it really work?

This sounds too good to be true! Does it REALLY work? Please do not
bullshit me, as I would like to take part in this system but do not
have much money right now.

How much have you made so far?

Also, if I do take part, is it add more names to the list all at the
same time? I have about 5 friends who would like to be in on this (I
printed out your email and showed it to them). One friend is a lawyer,
and he has written some reports on business law for coursework, can he
offer these reports instead of the ones listed?

Thanks for yor time in answering my queries!

Good Luck, and may we both make over 50,000!

Al.
