yes thats fine. i wrote your friend and explained to him the 
best i could. ask him to see the note i wrote to him. it is not 
his decison, it is yours.

i have had many people tell me the same thing and im still 
standing here. this is not a lottery but it is selling through 
the mail. thats called mail order. i am not forcing you to 
purchse my reports. you are buying them so you too can make money. 

lawyers like to defraud everything they dont understand, thats 
why im not a lawyer.
