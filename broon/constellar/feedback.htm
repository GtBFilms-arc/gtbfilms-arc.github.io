"I am a man who can tell a quality item when I see it, and let me tell you, the constellar.co.uk desk mug is one of the best examples of quality that I have seen for a long time. I am a keen purchaser of collectible items out of the back pages of Sunday magazines, which often turn out to be disappointing, but this item has exceeded all my expectations, Thank you!" Mr K.
