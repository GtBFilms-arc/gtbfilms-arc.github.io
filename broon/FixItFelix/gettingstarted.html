<div style="text-align: left;">
I obtained a second hand ION Icade cabinet from a friend. These cabinets were designed to house an Apple Ipad, and consist of a cabinet, and a bluetooth control panel (joystick and eight buttons with a faux illuminated coin slot on the front).

The first thing to do was to partially dismantle the cabinet, to see what could be removed, and how much space there was for new components.<P>

The control panel is attached with a number of screws, which required an allan key to remove.<P>

I measured the base and back of the cabinet and had three pieced of MDF cut:
<P>
Base section ( mm x mm)<br>
Back piece ( mm x mm)<br>
Marquee section ( mm x mm)<P>

My initial idea was to leave the cabinet pretty much as it was, and simply paint over the existing laminate. I spray painted it with primer, but after drying this immediately began to flake off. It was clear I'd need to remove the laminate art and get down to the MDF. <P>

Others who have performed a similar mod claimed that the laminate could be chipped off, but mine was stuck down well and I didn't want to damage the MDF, so instead I used a hairdryer on maximum heat setting to soften the glue then slowly peeled the lamitate art off the sides.

The glue on the sides made the MDF pretty rough, so I gave it a good sanding down with rough sandpaper to try and get a smoother finish. Then I applied two coats of spray primer again.
