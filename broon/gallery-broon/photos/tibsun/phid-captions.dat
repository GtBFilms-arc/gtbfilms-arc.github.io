5=>Another look at the huge box.
4=> 	Pride of place in PC World, a HUGE TS box. However they are wanting 34.99 rather than the 29.99 we paid, so maybe you get a HUGE box with every purchase.
3=>Straight off to PC World next for some scroll wheel mices.
2=>Having been to HMV Bruiser is triumphant with his purchase!
1=>The train arrives. I have to hold Bruiser back from the track as he is so eager to get into town.
