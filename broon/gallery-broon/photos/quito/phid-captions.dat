6=>View from the top of the tower of the city of Quito. 
5=>I think this leads down to the crypt.

3=>It's pretty grand in most of the churches. There was one where the inside was almost entirely covered in gold leaf. But you weren't allowed to take photos.
2=>It's apparently a replica of Notre Dame.
1=>This Church is still being built, and has been 'under construction' for 120 years.
0=>They like their churches in Quito, this is the first one we went into. Where I took some photos before I got Church fatigue.
