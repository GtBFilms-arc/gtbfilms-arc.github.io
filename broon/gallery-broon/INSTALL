Yapig - Yet Another PHP image gallery INSTALLATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Read README!

Yapig installation is very simple. Just follow this steps:

1) Edit config.php to customize your YAPIG.
 --> At least modify user and password options.
 --> Remove the STOP line at the end of this file.

2) Upload/Copy all files to your web server directory.
4) Upload your galleries to $BASE_DIR (default: photos/).

 --> Give 777(drwxrwxrwx) permissions to all galleries
     directories, including $BASE_DIR 
 

5) Run index.php, it will do yapig's installation (**), login as admin 
   and fill the "Add New Gallery" form.

** SAFE_MODE installation **

Some server admin set the php safe_mode which restricts some of the actions
yapig can perform automatically. One of these limitations is the installation.
Yapig creates a random name directory during install, but with safe mode it
can not do it, so you have to make this directory manually using ftp or a 
console, then give 777 permissions (for example: chmod 777 random_dir_name) 
and finally complete the form of yapig the installation.

SECURITY ADVICE
After installing YaPiG, it is heavily recommended to remove install.php file.
