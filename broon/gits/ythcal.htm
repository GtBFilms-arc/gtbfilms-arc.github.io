YTHCAL - LORD OF DEATH</H3><H4></B>
    Of the evil gods, Ythcal is the most powerful but he cares nothing for the affairs of
the world except when they provide an opportunity to increase his own strength. As he feeds upon the souls
of those sacrificed in his name he is greatly feared throughout the world.

     Ythcal grants his priests miracles of death in
exchange for their absolute loyalty. Even his priests fear him
for they know whould they fail him in any way their own lives will be forfeit. 
His priests can also use the
powers sponsered by the other evil gods; Fleyshur and
Molwanh.<p>

Ythcal's demands of his followers are simple to
understand. Regulal prayer, generous donations at his
temples, and regular sacrifices are essential. Although
animal sacrifices are acceptable, human sacrifices (or any
other sentient being  are preferable and the most likely to
gain favour. Unswerving obedience to Ythcal's demands
is also expected.<p>

There are no particular actions to which Ythcal
disapproves. If it does not harm him he is not interested.
Because of Ythcal's special power over the dead his most
loyal followers often become 'undead' when they die.<p>

<H3>DISEASE (501)</H3><H4></B>
A miracle only used by the most evil of priests. The victim will suffer a hideous
rotting disease, resulting eventually in death. The virulence of the disease is determined
by Ihe skill of the priest and his spiritual closeness to Ythcal.<br>
Spell target is the monster type, monster group, or player group to be affected.
<p>

<H3>CALL MONSTER (502)</H3><H4></B>
A very effective combat spell. When cast several warlike creatures will appear to
fight against the priests enemies. The type of creatures summoned will vary with the
priest's alignment. A priest of Ythcal would summon some form of undead, whereas a priest
of Molwanh would be more likely to summon Wolves or Carnivorous Apes. The
summoned creature will depart at the end of the combat.<br>
Target for the miracle is the rnonster type, monster group, or Player group, against
which you wish the summoned creature to fight.
<p>


<H3>YTHCALS TOUCH (503)</H3><H4></B>
A deadly ability which sucks the lifeforce from any creature touched. Lesser
creatures will be killed outright. More powerful ones will be weakened in all respects
(combat ability, toughness, will power, etc.) The drained life force is absorbed by the priest
and will help to heal any wounds he may have suffered. If sufficient force is drained he will
be restored to full health and fitness but diseases or poison will not be cured.<br>
Target for the miracle is the monster type, monster group or player group against
whom it is used.
