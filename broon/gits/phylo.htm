PHYLOQURE - MASTER OF SCROLLS</H3><H4></B>
Phyloqure is a reclusive god who has little to do with events among mortals. He has a fondness for the growth of
civilization and if approached with respect he will sometimes encourage and advise those who seek his help. He will
seldom provide direct answers to questions for he believes that knowledge must be earned if it is to have value.

He is usually worshipped by scholars or sages but a few adventurers, often mages, also choose to worship him. The
miracles he grants are unspectacular but can be useful to those seeking knowledge. Phyloqure is close in alignment
to Baldor and Novala and his priests can often use the powers sponsored by these gods.
<p>
Phyloqure encourages his followers to be law abiding and thoughtful and strongly disapproves of the use of violence
no matter what the circumstances. Groups choosing to follow Phyloqure should adopt a friendly attitude to all
encounters and a low retreat factor.
<p>
Deliberate attacks against other groups, or against monsters and NPCs will result in an immediate loss of favor as
will evil deeds of any kind. Even possessing a weapon will lose favor and as a result the life expectancy of
adventurers who choose to follow Phyloqure is even less than that of those who follow Sundonak. 
<p>

<H3>ORACLE (801)</H3><H4></B>
A miracle of knowledge. This can be used to obtain information on any item, monster or group. The priest enters a light trance
and when consciousness is regained, he will have received information of one kind or another relating to the target. 
<br>
Target for the miracle is the monster group, player group or item number about which information is required.
<p>

<H3>SLUMBER (802)</H3><H4></B>
A useful miracle for a priest trying to avoid bloodshed. This is a powerful ability, capable of putting most creatures into a deep
sleep, thus giving the priest and his group time to get away before a fight. (Killing the sleeping creatures would of course be an
evil act.)
<br>
The target for the miracle is the monster or player group to be affected.
<p>


<H3>REVELATION (803)</H3><H4></B>
This is the most powerful of the information providing miracles. It provides information on all aspects of the chosen target,
including location, magical properties, special abilities, value, other names, etc.
<br>
The target is the monster group, player group or item number the priest is trying to find out about.
