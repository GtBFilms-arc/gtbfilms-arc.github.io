FLEYSHUR - THE DESTROYER</H3><H4></B>
Fleyshur's adopted title leaves no doubt as to his outlook on life. Wanton
destruction of property, life, and civilisation itself are meat and drink to Fleyshur.
Earthly power is the reward promised to his followers for this crusade.

The miracles granted by Fleyshur are
sure to bring despair and misfortune to
Fleyshur's foes. His priests are also able to use
the miracles sponsored by Ythcal and
Sundonak, and the combination of evil and
outright violence is enough to strike fear into all
but the bravest, or most foolish, of opponents.<p>

Evil deeds and acts of senseless
violence are sure to gain Fleyshur's favour and
a hostile attitude should be adopted at all times.
Fleyshur understands that retreat is sometimes
necessary but will object to his followers setting
a low reteat factor. Prayer and regular
donations using the 'P' and 'G' orders are
expected, as is absolute obedience to
Fleyshur's commands.<p>

Fleyshur will not tolerate weakness
amongst his followers and strongly disapproves
of any acts of kindness or generosity towards
others. Failure to harm followers of Boldor or Garthrana at every opportunity will also
gain disfavour.

<p>

<H3>TERROR (401)</H3><H4></B>
A simple miracle which places fear in the hearts of the chosen target. A novice
priest will lower an enemies morale or cause craven creatures to flee. When used by
a more powerful priest this spell can cause instant death from pure terror.<br>
Target is the monster type, monster group, or player group to be affected.
<p>

<H3>POISON (402)</H3><H4></B>
With this miracle a priest creates a poison coating on the weapons of his
group. The potency of the poison will be determined by the power of the priest. The
poison will affect all living foes struck by the weapons in the next combat fought by
the group.<br>
No target is required for this miracle.
<p>

<H3>FLEYSHUR'S GIFT (403)</H3><H4></B>
A devestating curse by Fleyshur's priest against enemies of the sect. The
nature of this is variable. It's potency is determined by the priest's power and
Fleyshur's degree of hatred towards the afflicted individuals. The spell can also be
cast to curse an item.<br>
Target for this miracle is the monster, NPC, group or item to be cursed.
