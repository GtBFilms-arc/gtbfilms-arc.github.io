SUNDONAK - WARRIOR LORD</H3><H4></B>
    Sundonak is probably one of the most powerful gods, and certainly the most warlike. His priests teach that
Sundonak worshippers who die in battle will go to a warriors heaven. As a result the warriors committed to the
Sundonak sect are usually fearless in battle.

The miracles sponsored by Sundonak are all of use in combat and this helps his followers to stay alive a little
longer than would otherwise be possible. Even so, the reckless nature of their faith does considerably reduce the
life expectancy of Sundonak worshippers.
<p>
Sundonak has strong opinions on how his followers should behave and those wishing for his favor should be aware
of these.
<p>
Regular prayer and temple donations (using the 'P 3' order and the 'G' order ) are expected of course and all
Sundonak followers should adopt neutral or, even better, hostile attitudes using the 'A' order. Combat especially
against powerful opponents, is the fastest way to gain favor.
<p>
Cowardly or dishonorable deeds will bring disgrace and loss of favor immediately. The use of unnecessary magic,
fleeing from combat, theft, or even the use of missile weapons can earn Sundonak's displeasure.<p>

<H3>STRENGTH (301)</H3><H4></B>
Priests with this ability can summon the might of Sundonak to imbue your group with great strength to aid them in combat. As a
priest grows more powerful, or closer to Sundonak, the strength gained will also grow. The extra strength gained dissipates at
the end of a game week.
<br>
Write a target of '99' when using this miracle.
<p>

<H3>BERSERK (302)</H3><H4></B>

With this miracle the priest fills his group with reckless courage. They will fight against overwhelming odds and their obvious
determination will often daunt a timid foe. Unlike the mage spell Battle Lust, the group are not totally consumed by their
recklessness and still will recognize the group retreat factors set prior to the battle.
<br>
Write a target of '99' to use this miracle.
<p>


<H3>WRATH OF SUNDONAK (303)</H3><H4></B>
With this miracle the faithful of Sundonak may call down his power to smite their foes. The WRATH usually takes the form of a
great ball of fire. Sundonak will not support the use of this power against foes who might be defeated by other means. If the
power is called for use against an obviously inferior foe, Sundonak may show his displeasure by turning his wrath against the
summoning priest.
<br>
Target for this miracle is the monster type, monster group or player group to be affected.
