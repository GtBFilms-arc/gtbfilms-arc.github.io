GARTHRANA - THE AVENGER</H3><H4></B>
Although somewhat less influential than Baldor, the goddess Garthrana is far more greatly feared by the followers
of evil. Garthrana's followers are charged with the destruction of evil in whatever it is found.

Garthrana aids her followers by granting them the use of combat orientated miracles to help them in their battles.
As Baldor and Sundonak are both close to Garthrana in terms of alignment, her followers can often use the
miracles sponsored by these gods. 
<p>
The temples of Garthrana teach that certain actions and attitudes are necessary for any priest or group wishing to
gain her favor. 
<p>
Firstly all groups hoping to align themselves with Garthrana should pray to her regularly by issuing the order 'P 2'.
They are also encouraged to make donations at her temples using the 'G' order. Attacking the followers of the evil
gods will always gain favor.
<p>
Using an attitude of anything but '3' against evil groups will cause displeasure and failure to attack evil when there
is a good chance of victory is even worse. Theft of any kind will earn nothing but Garthrana's contempt for the
group concerned.
<p>

<H3>KILL UNDEAD (201)</H3><H4></B>
Garthrana is strongly opposed to the existence of the undead and this miracle is a powerful weapon against them.
Inexperienced priests will only be able to repel the weaker forms of undead, but those will more experience (or devout
followers of Garthrana) will be able to blast weaker undead out of existence and even more powerful undead types will be
forced to flee.
<br>
The target is the monster class or group to be affected. 
<p>

<H3>FLAME (202)</H3><H4></B>
With this miracle the priest summons the holy fires of Garthrana. The weapons of the priest's group will burst into flame. This
does not harm the group, or the weapons, but greatly increases the damage caused by the weapons during the next round of
combat. The flames will harm creatures not affected by normal weaponry.
<br>
The target for this miracle is '99'.
<p>


<H3>BLESS (203)</H3><H4></B>
A powerful offensive and defensive spell. A blessed group receives partial protection from all kinds of harm and is more likely
to hit during combat against all kinds of foe. It can also be used to neutralize a curse.
<br>
Target for the spell is monster, group character or item to be blessed. A target of '99' blesses your group.
