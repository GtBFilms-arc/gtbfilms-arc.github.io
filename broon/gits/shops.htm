<H1>
Alchemist</H1>
<FONT SIZE=+1>Alchemists specialise in the study and preparation of unusual
compounds. A few of them waste their time trying to change lead into gold
but those with any sense make a highly profitable living selling spell
components to mages. Some powders will be a lot rarer than others and this
will be reflected in the prices which an alchemist charges. Spell components
are always sold in small leather pouches, each of which holds five 'doses',
i.e. enough for five spells.</FONT>
<H1>
Armourer</H1>
<FONT SIZE=+1>There are a wide variety of shops selling armour. Some are
owned by leather workers, some by blacksmiths and some can provide the
skills of both crafts. As well as selling the armour shown, they are also
prepared to buy used armour of any kind. They will also buy used weapons.
To sell a piece of armour or a weapon, use the 'H' order. Armour is often
in great demand and armourers do a brisk trade. Shop defences are variable
and they are often a target for enterprising thieves.</FONT>
<H1>
Cartographer</H1>
<FONT SIZE=+1>Many years ago, when the land of Kharne was fully mapped,
travel from one town to another was easy and trouble-free. Since then,
the wilderness has been infested with all manner of deadly creatures and
to make matters worse, most of the maps showing the locations of other
towns have been lost. Cartographers own most of those remaining but even
they only have maps showing the area around the town in which they live.</FONT>
<H1>
Credit Dealer</H1>
<FONT SIZE=+1>Carrying large sums of money is a risky business, especially
in the wilderness. When merchants travel from one town to another they
usually convert most of their cash into a Letter of Credit. These can be
bought from the credit dealers found in most major towns and then converted
back into cash on arrival at their destination. Write 'B (char) (shop)
(amount)' to purchase a Letter of Credit at a shop providing this service.
There will usually be a charge of 10 gold pieces for this service. To convert
the letter back into gold, find another shop providing this service and
use 'B (char) (shop) 0' to hand the Letter of Credit to the shop. Again,
there may be a small charge. Like other merchants providing financial services,
they will be wealthy but well guarded.</FONT>
<H1>
Disused Shop</H1>
<FONT SIZE=+1>Some shops thrive and prosper but others fare less well.
Perhaps the owner died without an heir, or the shop was simply unable to
provide sufficient funds to live on. Whatever the reason, most towns will
have several empty or disused buildings.</FONT>
<H1>
Food Shop</H1>
<FONT SIZE=+1>Rations can be bought in even the smallest villages. The
type of shop varies, depending upon location. In villages, your group will
usually buy food direct from a farm, whereas in a town or city, rations
are usually bought from a market stall. There will seldom be anything of
real value kept by the owner and these places are not worth robbing. Rations
are essential for any group not staying at an inn. Each character will
consume one ration per turn.</FONT>
<H1>
General Store</H1>
<FONT SIZE=+1>After food stores and inns, these are amongst the commonest
shops. None of the items on sale are essential for successful adventuring
but all are useful in certain circumstances. Even if you can't think of
a use for them now, buy some in case you need them later. General stores
are also willing to buy low-value treasure items.</FONT>
<H1>
Gymnasium</H1>
<FONT SIZE=+1>Combat training of one kind or another can be found in many
towns. Most gymnasia have one or more instructors who are experts in at
least one type of exercise, usually body-building or weapons training.
To make the most of the training, a character should have at least 100
experience points. If the training is successful, some or all of the experience
points will be converted to skill points.</FONT>
<H1>
Inn</H1>
<FONT SIZE=+1>Most towns and cities have at least one inn or lodging house
where weary adventurers may rest and recover from their injuries. The cost
of a night's rest includes food and a character at an inn will not need
to consume rations during that turn. Inns are also a good place to catch
up on the local gossip and some provide opportunities for professional
gamblers to indulge in games of chance. Although gambling is common, games
are usually played for pennies. The stakes at professional gambling dens
can be up to 1,000 gold pieces.</FONT>
<H1>
Jeweller</H1>
<FONT SIZE=+1>Jewels are often used as an alternative currency as they
are so much less bulky than gold coins of equivalent value. They are also
easier to hide. Rather than load themselves down with large bags of gold,
many travellers buy gems and then convert the gems back into cash when
they arrive at their destination. Jewellers will also be willing to buy
most kinds of valuable treasure for a fair price.</FONT>
<H1>
Library</H1>
<FONT SIZE=+1>Most libraries are privately owned by wealthy merchants who
charge a hefty fee to permit adventurers to study there. After all, books
and scrolls are rare, valuable items. Most texts relate to the local history
of the region and a library is therefore an excellent source of information
on nearby ruins and dungeons.</FONT>
<H1>
Magic Guild</H1>
<FONT SIZE=+1>The magic guilds of Kharne are centres of learning for all
kinds of arcane knowledge. Many have libraries to aid mages in spell research,
and teachers who can improve the skill of the mages in your group. The
teaching is expensive and to gain full benefit a student should have at
least 100 experience points. The guilds are also interested in all kinds
of magical artefact and will pay fair prices for items with special powers
or enchantments.</FONT>
<H1>
Merchant Banker</H1>
<FONT SIZE=+1>Carrying large sums of money is not only dangerous, but it
is also tiring. Many towns have a merchant who will be willing to look
after your group's funds while they are adventuring. They will usually
make a small charge for this service. Write the order 'B (char/99) (shop)
(amount)' to deposit gold at a shop providing this service. You can reclaim
it with the order 'B (char/99) (shop) (amount)'. Note that each merchant
banker has two shop numbers, one for making deposits and one for withdrawals.
These merchants are obviously wealthy men but they defend their property
well, making a robbery against them a chancy business.</FONT>
<H1>
Money-lender</H1>
<FONT SIZE=+1>The money-lenders of Kharne are wealthy but unpopular men.
Their wealth makes them a tempting target for thieves but most are well
guarded. Novice burglars should seek a more vulnerable target. Any group
can borrow money from a money-lender. The amount which can be borrowed
will be based upon the money-lender's assessment of the group's capabilities,
up to a maximum of 1000 gold. To borrow money, write the order 'B (char/99)
(shop) (amount)'. Money-lenders charge 20% interest and the loan must be
cleared within 15 days (turns). To repay, write 'G (char/99) (shop) (amount)'.
Loans may be repaid at any money-lenders. Failure to make a repayment can
result in serious punishment and money-lenders all over Kharne are in regular
contact.</FONT>
<H1>
News</H1>
<FONT SIZE=+1>News travels fast and most towns have up-to-date information
on the events of the surrounding area. You can purchase this information
and get a list of parties in town at this shop. There may also be news
of special quests which are available.</FONT>
<H1>
Temple</H1>
<FONT SIZE=+1>Temples are amongst the most important buildings of any major
town or city. The priests who reside there can provide a range of valuable
services. Temples will also accept tithes from worshipers. If your group
prays to a god while in town they will do so at that god's temple if there
is one. Temples will sometimes refuse entry to groups whose alignment is
strongly opposed to that of the temple. Some temples can provide special
training for your characters. To gain full benefit from this training,
a character should have at least 100 experience points. Temples will pay
a fair price for any treasure items that you wish to sell. Most temples
are well guarded and they are not recommended as targets for the light-fingered
members of your group.</FONT>
<H1>
Thieves' Guild</H1>
<FONT SIZE=+1>These semi-legal organisations are a common feature of town
life. Many guilds operate in secret and you can only find the guild building
if you are very lucky. Most guilds are able to provide special training
to improve the skill and awareness of thieves and to improve the awareness
of non-thieves. To gain full benefit from this training, a character should
have at least 100 experience points. These guilds are a good place to sell
unwanted treasure items, especially valuable ones.</FONT>
<H1>
Travel</H1>
<FONT SIZE=+1>The fastest and safest way to travel in these troubled times
is by boat or stagecoach. Most towns or cities have coach stables, and
a small port if they are on the coast. Here you can purchase transport
to other towns. This method of transport is expensive (the cost shown is
per person), but quick. The journey occurs during your turn and you will
arrive at your destination in time to complete your remaining orders. Note
that some destinations are just dropping-off points and booking a return
journey may not be possible.</FONT>
<H1>
Weaponsmith</H1>
<FONT SIZE=+1>On Kharne, weaponsmith is a general term which includes weapon
makers with no smithing skills, such as bowyers. In addition to selling
the items shown, weaponsmiths will usually be willing to buy weapons and
armour of any kind. To sell equipment to a weaponsmith use the 'H' order.
Shops selling weapons, especially expensive ones, tend to be quite wealthy
and make good targets for skilful thieves.</FONT>
