EARTH ELEMENTAL
	Earth elementals live deep within the earth. No-one knows their purpose but they can be 
summoned and directed by powerful magic. They have control over the earth and rock of which the 
world is composed and amongst other things can cause earthquakes and volcanoes. They have no 
physical body and can not be harmed by any ordinary means but certain kinds of magic can hold 
them at bay.
