GUZZARD
	The guzzard is an eight legged lizard with an unusual, and 
dangerous, method of feeding. Its mouth is a funnel shaped snout. 
From this snout it shoots out a spray of digestive juices. The snout 
can control the spray to cover a wide area, or to produce a narrow 
jet capable of striking at up to twenty yards. The juices are very 
strong and will kill most small creatures immediately. The guzzard 
then sucks up the predigested goo that remains of its victims body.
