GARMYK
The garmyk is a large amphibious creature. It looks vaguely like 
a huge black frog with glowing red eyes. The garmyk hunts at night 
when it is almost impossible to see in the darkness. Its red eyes 
are hypnotic and anyone gazing into them will be entranced. The 
garmyk then creeps forwards and slowly feeds by licking the flesh 
from its victim with its long acid coated tongue. Although in agony 
the victim is totally unable to move or cry out. Several parties of 
adventurers tell of the times they have risen in the morning to 
discover their watchman a bloody corpse.
