KRESH
	Similar to a wolf but larger, more intelligent and more 
powerful. Like wolves, kresh will hunt in a pack and it is the growing
number of them that has driven most wolves to dwell in forest terrain.
Kresh now rule the open and rough terrain where wolves once held 
supreme. The innate savagery of the kresh makes it partially resistant 
to most spells affecting the mind (eg Sleep). They are easily 
recognised by their bristly yellow fur and long scrawny bodies.
