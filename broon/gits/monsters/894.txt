GATHERER
	This creature looks like a large human brain, as big as a medium-sized dog, which moves 
using a number of tentacles. Most gatherers have between eight and twelve of these. The soft-looking 
surface of the 'brain' is in fact a hard chitinous carapace. Attached to the front of the brain by slender 
stalks are two floating eyes. Despite its unpleasant appearance, this creature is in fact a friendly, 
peaceful being, whose only concern is to gather as much knowledge as possible, hence its name. It is 
said that they were put in the world by Phyloqure to gather and spread knowledge around Kharne. It is 
believed that killing one of these creatures will bring bad luck and will anger Phyloqure. The gatherer 
is a creature which most characters would rather talk to than fight, anyway, since it is very likely that it 
has some interesting information of the geography and other features of the area where it is found.
