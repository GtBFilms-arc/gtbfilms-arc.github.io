AIR ELEMENTAL
	The air elementals are powerful spirits with power over the wind. They can cause storms, 
whirlwinds or total calm depending upon their mood. Certain spells can summon and control them 
but this makes them very angry and they will break free and attack their summoner if at all possible. 
They have no physical body and can not be harmed by ordinary means.
