VALKYRIE
The Valkyries serve the goddess Garthrana. They are powerful spirits able to take physical shape 
and usually appear as beautiful female warriors, the image of Garthrana herself. They are stronger 
than any mortal fighter and move with a speed and skill impossible to imitate. Their armour can not 
be pierced by any ordinary means and their weapons can cleave through the strongest defences. Pure 
hearted priests who worship Garthrana can sometimes summon a Valkyrie to aid them in times of 
need.
