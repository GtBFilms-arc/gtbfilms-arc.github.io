SHAMBLER
	Shamblers are huge man shaped masses of vegetation found in 
swamp terrain. They shuffle and lurch along hence their name. It 
feeds by sucking blood from any warm blooded creature it can catch. 
Its body and arms are covered with numerous little toothy suckers. 
Shamblers have no vital organs and have to be hacked completely to 
pieces to be killed. Fire will also kill them but as they live in 
watery terrain they can quickly douse any fires by rolling over on 
the wet ground.
