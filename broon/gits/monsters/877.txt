LICH
	For centuries man has sought for ways to cheat death and the Lich is the result of one 
avenue of research. With demonic assistance a powerful mage can retain a form of life after death. 
Unfortunately the influence of the demon always comes to dominate the mage's spirit and Lich's are 
invariably evil, twisted beings with a hatred for the normal life they have lost. A lich is a deadly foe 
for in addition to special powers acquired with their undead status they retain the full intelligence of 
their former life and a full knowledge of the spells learned as a mage during that life.
