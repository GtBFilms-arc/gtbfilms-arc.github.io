BALROG
	Also known as the Fangs of Fleyshur these fearsome creatures 
are demons of death and destruction. They stand at about ten feet tall.
With their batwings, forked tails, great claws and teeth and the 
demonic flames which constantly flicker around them they can strike 
fear into the bravest of foes. In combat the flames grow in heat and 
intensity and anyone fighting it at close quarters will be severely 
burned. Although they sometimes fight with their natural weaponry most 
balrogs prefer to use huge flaming swords or whips.
