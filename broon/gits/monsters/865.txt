RAT
		As expected rats are vicious disease carrying rodents. 
They can be found anywhere but they flourish in towns and cities. They 
will usually avoid combat but if cornered they will bite and claw 
anything which threatens them. The injuries themselves are seldom 
serious but will often become infected leading to illness and possibly 
death. The rats encountered as monsters are similar to ordinary rats 
but of gigantic size, often up to six feet in length (not including 
the tail). At this size the wounds they can inflict are often deadly.
