TROLL
	Trolls are ghastly carnivores of humanoid form. They are tall 
and scrawny but immensely powerful, capable of tearing small trees 
from the ground to use as a club. They can also attack with their 
sharp teeth and claws. Trolls are almost impossible to kill as they 
can regenerate damaged flesh with incredible speed. Even severed limbs 
can be regrown in a matter of minutes. Only fire or acid can slow this 
healing.
