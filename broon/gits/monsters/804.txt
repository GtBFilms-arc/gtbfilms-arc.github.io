HARPIES
	The foul harpy is recognised as one of the most disgusting 
creatures of the world. They have the upper body of a hag and the 
wings and legs of a bird. They live underground or in mountain caves 
and prey upon anything which moves. Their nests are filthy and even 
orcs complain about the smell when a harpy passes downwind. Harpies 
attack with their sharp claws and the powerful talons on their legs. 
The accumulated filth on the claws acts as a paralysing poison, the 
downfall of many adventurers.
