NYMPH
	Nymphs are the spiritual servants of Molwanh. They inhabit the 
forests and protect the trees from harm with their special powers. 
They can move invisibly, cause magical confusion or sleep. Travellers 
who respect the forests will usually be left undisturbed but some 
nymphs are malicious creatures and will torment intruders for pleasure.
