VENUS MAN TRAP
	The venus man trap is a carnivorous plant with a taste for warm flesh. It grows like a vine 
but along the ground instead of up walls or trees. Every few yards along its length there are large 
hinged leaves covered in sharp spines and soft tendrils (which look a bit like grass). The leaves 
blend in with the surrounding terrain until trodden upon. They then snap together trapping 
whatever did the treading. The spines often cause death but even if the trapped creature survives the 
wounds it will soon be consumed by the plants digestive juices. Each half of the leaves measures 
about five feet across so they are easily capable of trapping a human body.
