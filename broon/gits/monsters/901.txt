KNIGHT-LORE
	Knight-lores are believed to be fanatical followers of Sundonak who roam the land searching 
for anyone, or anything, to do battle with. They are masters of combat, and appear as heavily armoured 
knights who fight with great, two-handed swords. They live only to serve Sundonak by fighting all they 
can. They strive to prove their superiority at combat, and fight honourably and fairly to this end. 
Sundonak has shown his appreciation of these warriors by granting them an incredible resistance to 
magic, forcing opponents to fight them in 'fair' melee combat.
