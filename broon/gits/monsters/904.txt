FARMER
	Farmers are often found in the fields of Kharne, tending their crops or looking after their 
livestock. They frequently get angry with adventuring parties who stroll through their land, destroying 
the crops and startling the herds. Such irate farmers have been known to chase parties through the 
countryside for several miles, hurling abuse and threats, such as 'Get off my land!' and 'Stop interfering 
with my sheep!'.
