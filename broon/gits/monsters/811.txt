ELVES
	Elves have the longest lifespan of the humanoid races and this 
makes them feel superior to other races, whom they tend to look down 
upon. Apart from this they are usually decent, honest folk. Although 
jewellery or valuable gems are precious to them most also enjoy the 
simple things in life and are content to live in peace and harmony. 
Despite this they are ready to fight if necessary and do so with 
devastating effect especially in all kinds of woodland terrain where 
they are able to move virtually undetected. Although most elves worship
the gods of peace or good a few have turned to evil.
