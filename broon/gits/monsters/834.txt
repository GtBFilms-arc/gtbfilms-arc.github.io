BEAR
	Most bears are herbivores but they are short tempered and 
aggressive. Intelligent adventurers will give them a wide berth. They 
can be killed by a competent group but there is little point and the 
risk of serious injury is too great. They are especially dangerous if
protecting a mate or offspring.
