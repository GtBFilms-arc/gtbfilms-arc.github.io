SLIME MOLD
	A mindless but deadly creature of the underworld. Scholars are 
unable to agree whether this strange being is a plant or an animal. It 
moves slowly across stone surfaces devouring any organic material in 
its path. It can climb up walls and across ceilings without difficulty 
and will sometimes drop onto a living creature from above. The slime 
is very persistent. Once it has infected living flesh it is almost 
impossible to remove. The unfortunate victim will slowly be transformed
into slime.
