JINX
	These powerful and free willed spirits are the servants of Novala. They enjoy playing with 
mortal lives by bringing incredible good luck and then disastrous misfortune. The elation then 
despair of their victims and their actions and reactions are highly amusing. Novala's most devout 
priests can summon a jinx to help them or more often to harm a foe. The misfortune brought by a 
jinx can often be fatal and they are immune to harm by any ordinary means.
