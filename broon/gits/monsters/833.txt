GIANT CRAB
	The large crushing claws of the giant crab make it a fearsome 
opponent but even worse than this is the great difficulty experienced 
when trying to hit back. The giant crab's shell is incredibly tough 
and there are few vulnerable areas. Clubs, daggers, and similar weapons
 are almost useless against them. They usually live in coastal regions 
but can also be found in swamps and marshes.
