WALL DWELLER
	In the endless number of dungeons below the surface of Kharne, many beings exist which have 
never seen the light of the sun. Amongst these are the wall dwellers. Literally born out of fear and 
concentrated darkness, the wall dwellers are capable of moving through solid rock the way we move 
through air. This enables them to give most adventurers a nasty surprise when, all of a sudden, the wall 
seems to come to life. They take on a roughly human form and their skin looks exactly like the wall 
they have come from. They are very hostile and hard to hurt, as they are partly immaterial, tough, and 
have a certain understanding of the ways of magic.
