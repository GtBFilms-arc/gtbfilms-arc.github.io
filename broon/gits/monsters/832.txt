GIANT CROCODILE
	This huge reptile presents a very real threat to any 
adventurer travelling through jungle or swamp terrain. They move 
swiftly and silently through water and with only their nostrils above
the surface they are often not sighted until too late. Larger 
specimens can cut a man in two with a single chomp of their tooth 
filled jaws or break backs with a swipe of their tail. If all else 
fails a favoured tactic is to grab hold and submerge, thereby drowning
their victim.
