KHARNE PYTHON
	This is a huge poisonous snake, growing up to thirty feet in
length. Its poison is extremely deadly. Variants of the snake can be 
found underground, in jungles, or in desert terrain. In each case the 
snakes colour has adapted to suit the environment. Underground snakes 
are a dark brown, or black, those found in the desert are a sandy 
brown, and the jungle variant is dark green. This is a great help in 
surprising its victims most of whom do not notice its presence until 
they feel teeth in their necks and crushing coils wrapping around 
their limbs.
