GORGON
	Like the Medusa of legend, Gorgons are evil creatures with the
 body of a woman and a tangle of poisonous snakes for their hair. 
Gorgons have sharp claws and teeth and the snakes are obviously 
dangerous but their deadliest weapon is their petrifying gaze. Anyone 
meeting their stare will be turned to lifeless stone. They are found 
only underground.
