GIANT SCORPION
	Like its smaller cousins the giant scorpion dwells in barren 
or desert terrain and is equipped with a real sting in the tail. 
Unlike an ordinary scorpion few adventurers make the mistake of 
treading on one! Would you tread on a eight foot long monster with 
armour plating, two foot claws, and ten feet of poison tipped tail? 
Probably not.
