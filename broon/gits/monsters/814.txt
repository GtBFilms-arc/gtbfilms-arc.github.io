GNOMES
	Gnomes are related to dwarves but are of lighter build and 
generally more pleasant to get on with. They are less stubborn and 
opinionated and have an active sense of humour. Like dwarves, gnomes 
are highly skilled smiths but they specialize in jewellery and clever 
mechanical devices (locks for example), rather than in armour and 
weaponry. They can be found all over the world but usually make their 
homes in hilly or mountainous terrain.
