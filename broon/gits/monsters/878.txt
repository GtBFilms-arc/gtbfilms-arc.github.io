HOUNDS OF DEATH
	The hounds are the spiritual servants of Sundonak. They appear as gigantic wolf like beasts 
with fangs, claws and sharp ridges along their spines. They will sometimes appear to assist 
followers of Sundonak in battle or to kill followers of Sundonak who have disgraced the sect. The 
hounds appear to be almost indestructible but can sometimes be held at bay or dispelled by powerful 
priests of the other gods.
