GIANT FROG
	The giant frog is like an ordinary frog in all respects apart 
from its great size (about five feet long) and its poisonous bite. 
Most live in swamps or marshes but they are sometimes found in 
underground dwellings or deep jungle. Characters bitten by the giant 
frog often contract a fever which saps toughness and health.
