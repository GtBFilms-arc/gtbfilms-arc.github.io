WATER ELEMENTAL
Water elementals are the spirits of the ocean. They can control the waves to cause calm oceans or 
gigantic tidal waves, capable of smashing ships or demolishing coastal buildings. Like other 
elementals they are not intelligent but they can be summoned and controlled by powerful magic.
