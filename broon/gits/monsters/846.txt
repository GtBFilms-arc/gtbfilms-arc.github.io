PURPLE FUNGI
	Purple fungi or Stone Cap is a deadly mushroom like growth. It
feeds upon the nutrients found in dead flesh and has an effective 
method of capturing sustenance. Special organs on its dome shaped top 
are sensitive to heat. When it is detected the organs open up and 
release deadly rays similar to those used by the medusa. When these 
rays meet flesh it turns into lifeless stone usually killing the
victim. The fungi then slithers towards the corpse and sucks the 
nutrients from the unpetrified portions of the body.
