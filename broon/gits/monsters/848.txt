MOUNTAIN GIANT
	Bigger, uglier, meaner, and stupider than just about anything 
you have ever met before is the hideous mountain giant. This is the 
largest of the giants and like its fellows enjoys food, drink and 
fighting, not necessarily in that order. They are extremely primitive
and most live in squalid caves in mountainous terrain. They smell 
really bad, half body odour and half from the uncured animal skins 
they use for clothing and armour.
