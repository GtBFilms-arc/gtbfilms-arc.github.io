IMP
	Imps are small demonic creatures who serve the evil gods. 
They have ugly little faces with pointed fangs, bat wings and long 
tails with a pointed tip. They usually act as messengers between the 
gods and mortals but are sometimes given other tasks to perform. 
As they are only about two feet tall they will always try to avoid 
combat.
