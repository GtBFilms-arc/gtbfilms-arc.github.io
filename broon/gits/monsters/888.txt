DARK OAK
	Dark oaks are trees possessed by the malevolent spirit servants of Molwanh. Not only can 
the trees move but they can control the other trees and plantlife for miles around. Like their mistress 
they hate all civilised life and will try to kill any humanoid creature passing through their area of 
control. The spirit creates paths which lead travellers closer to its centre of influence and then 
removes the paths behind them to prevent them turning back. As they get closer brambles will lash 
out at them, heavy branches fall from above and finally the trees close in to crush frail bodies 
between them.
