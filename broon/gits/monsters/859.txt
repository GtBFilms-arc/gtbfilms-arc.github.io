WEREWOLF
	The werewolf is a man infected with the disease of lycanthropy. 
When the moon is full and at times of stress the man transforms into 
a wolflike monster with sharp claws, bristly fur and powerful jaws. It 
is immensely strong and fast and seems to be unharmed by ordinary 
weapons. Humans or half-bloods bitten by a werewolf will sometimes 
become infected with the disease themselves. Many victims are unaware 
of their illness for several months as they retain no memory of events 
which occur while they are in wolf form.
