STINGER PLANT
	The stinger plant feeds upon the rotting bodies of the dead. To ensure that creatures die in 
the right place the plant is equipped with numerous whip like stalks, each tipped with a poisoned 
sting. As soon as a victim is close enough the stalks lash out to inject their poison. Although the 
poison is not particularly strong sufficient stings can kill even large creatures such as a horse. To 
prevent victims rolling away during their death throes the stalks will wrap around them and pull 
them close.
