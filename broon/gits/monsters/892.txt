LIFE BRINGER
	Each of the gods has spiritual servants to do his bidding and those who aid Baldor are known 
as the Life Bringers. They are powerful spirits able to cure any injury, disease or poison. They are even 
capable of restoring life to the dead. They can also protect Baldor's worshippers from harm by putting 
their enemies to sleep or creating a spiritual shield, impervious to magical and physical attacks. They 
will sometimes appear in answer to the prayers of a devout priest who worships Baldor.
