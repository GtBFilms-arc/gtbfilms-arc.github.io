VAMPIRE BAT
	The vampire bat is not particularly large or fierce but is 
dangerous nonetheless. It attacks at night when its victims are asleep
 and the saliva on its teeth numbs pain and prevents its attack being 
noticed. It usually flaps away with a belly full of blood before anyone
 notices it. The effects are obvious the following morning. The bat's 
victim will be pale and weak from loss of blood. The bat often infects 
its victim with disease which will result in
death within several months unless a cure is found. The vampire bat 
resides in jungle terrain or underground.
