WHITE APE
	This beast is actually a stony grey colour but usually hunts 
at night when reflected moonlight gives it a ghostly white appearance.
It moves silently and swiftly often managing to surprise its victims. 
It is immensely strong, has sharp claws and teeth, and is highly 
intelligent. It is usually found in mountain terrain.
