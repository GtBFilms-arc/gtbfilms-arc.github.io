BANSHEE
	The banshee is a deadly beast capable of causing death by the power of its voice. In combat 
it emits a high pitched screech which shatters the eardrums and destroys the brain. The banshee 
itself is practically deaf and therefore immune to these effects. Banshees look like bedraggled 
witches with long stringy hair and tatty robes. Their deafness makes them easy to surprise and apart 
from their screech they have no effective attacks.
