STING BAT
This subterranean flyer is well adapted to its environment. It can 
fly in total darkness and its dark colouration makes it almost 
invisible in poor lighting. The sting bat's teeth are coated with a 
sleep venom but its main attack form is the poisonous stinger at the 
end of its whip like tail. This strikes with deadly accuracy and the
poison is invariably fatal unless neutralised quickly.
