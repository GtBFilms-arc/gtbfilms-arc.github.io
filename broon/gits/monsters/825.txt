GIANT TOAD
	Giant toads can be found in swamps all over the world and 
occasionally in underground caverns. With their poisonous bite they 
are a deadly opponent for any adventurer. They are not particularly 
intelligent and will usually sustain heavy losses before considering 
retreat. They are afraid of fire.
