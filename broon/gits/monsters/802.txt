CENTAUR
	The centaur is an intelligent and usually friendly denizen of 
rough or woodland terrain. They live by hunting and growing simple 
crops. They can use their hooves to good effect in combat but most 
prefer to fight with bows or spears. Centaurs are a conscientious folk 
and good to their environment and for this Molwanh looks on them with
favour. For the centaurs she is regarded as a god of peace and 
harmony rather than evil.
