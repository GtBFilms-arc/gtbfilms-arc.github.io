SKELETON
With magical assistance or the co-operation of evil spirits it is 
possible for a mage or priest to animate a skeleton to do his bidding. 
The animated skeleton will have no mind of its own and will act only 
to obey the commands of its creator. Since they have no fear of death 
they will never turn away from combat.
