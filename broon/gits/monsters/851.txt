JUGGERNAUT
	The juggernaut is an animated metal statue created by magical 
means. It has no mind of its own and exists only to carry out its 
creators wishes. It will continue to follow its masters instructions 
long after his death. There are rumours that it is possible for 
another mage to take control of the juggernaut but the means to do so 
have never been discovered. The juggernaut is immensely strong and 
almost invulnerable.
