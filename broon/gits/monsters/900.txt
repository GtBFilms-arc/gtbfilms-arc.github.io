MIST REAVER
	Mist reavers are soul-less entities of the night. They appear at sundown and wander the lands 
of Kharne in search of victims on which to feed. Mist reavers are powerful undead monsters, and as 
such they require living beings from which they can drain precious life-energy, which often results in 
the death of the victim. They are also drawn to the magical energy inherent in mages and priests alike, 
and they have been known to attack adventuring parties, feeding on those killed by their lethal touch.
