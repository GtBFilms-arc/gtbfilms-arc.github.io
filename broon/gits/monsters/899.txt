SKY RAY
	These beautiful, majestic relations of the sting ray can be found flying across the skies of 
Kharne. They appear identical to their aquatic cousins in all but size. Sky rays can grow to anything up 
to 30 feet long and 40 feet wide. In addition to this, sky rays have a long tail, which is actually a deadly 
weapon. By some freak of nature, sky rays' tails carry a massive electric charge, comparable to a bolt of 
lightning in power, which can kill most man-sized creatures outright. Fortunately, they are usually 
docile creatures, killing only for food. Sky rays prey on deer, horses and, rarely, humanoids. They travel 
singly unless hunting, when they form into groups of up to 5 rays.
