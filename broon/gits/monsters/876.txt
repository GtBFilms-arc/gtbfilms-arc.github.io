VAMPIRE
	The vampire is a combination of evil spirit and living flesh. The spirit feeds upon fresh 
blood and exists within the blood of its host. The spirit alters its host body to make it more suitable 
for its aims. As a result vampires are immensely strong, can regenerate damage, and have excellent 
senses. When a vampire grows strong enough it can create a new vampire by forcing a victim to 
drink the vampires own blood. With a form of hypnosis vampires have a limited degree of control 
over the actions of ordinary mortals.
