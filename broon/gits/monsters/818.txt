ORCS
	Orcs are the commonest of the goblin races. They are about five
 feet tall and recognisable by their sharp teeth and claws, swarthy 
complexion, pug noses and scraggy ears. Orcs are arrogant, vicious, 
mean, greedy, violent, stupid, smelly, lazy, cowardly, etc, etc. Their 
only good feature is the eagerness with which they kill each other when
 noone else is handy. If it were not for a total lack of organisation 
and their inability to co-operate orcs would be a very serious threat 
to civilisation. Most orc tribes worship Fleyshur.
