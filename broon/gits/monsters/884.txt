DOPPLEGANGER
	Dopplegangers are humanoid creatures with the ability to change their shape and 
appearance to mimic others. To make the impersonation more effective they can also imitate voices 
and they have a telepathic ability to read the minds of those around them. This gives them a full 
knowledge of the person they are imitating and enables them to act as others expect them to at all 
times. As they are carnivores they usually kill and eat someone and then take their place. They can 
then kill and eat others without being suspected.
