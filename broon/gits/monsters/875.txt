MUMMY
	When an evil spirit possesses a dead body the result is the dreaded mummy. The spirit will 
usually select a body which has been well preserved but a rotting corpse is sufficient. The spirit 
imbues the corpse with enormous strength and because of its nature, wounds inflicted by a mummy 
will be infected with a rotting disease which will prevent the wounds from healing until the disease 
is cured.
