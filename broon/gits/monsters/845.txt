GREEN FUNGI
	Most fungi are fairly harmless to adventurers but green fungi 
is one of the exceptions. In appearance they look like large mushrooms
with a pale green colouration. If the fungi is struck or detects sudden
 noises nearby it will explode releasing a cloud of dark green spores. 
The spores are poisonous and cause wound rot if they land on an injured
 character. Infected wounds will not heal (even with magical assistance
) unless the wound rot is cured first.
