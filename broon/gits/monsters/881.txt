FIRE ELEMENTAL
	Fire elementals are powerful and destructive spirits with the ability to control and direct 
fire or all kinds. Although they can be summoned by powerful magic this activity is outlawed in 
most towns because of the dreadful consequences should the elemental break free. The elementals 
resent being enslaved and on breaking free they burn anything and everything in their path.
