GIANT BEETLE
	A vegetarian beast but a real menace nonetheless. The giant 
beetle has cultivated tastes and likes nothing better than fresh grain,
raw potato, and fruit dessert. Farms all over Kharne wage a constant 
war against these voracious monsters with varying degrees of success.
A hungry beetle is no joking matter and many farmers have died trying 
to protect their crops. Giant beetles can also be found dwelling 
underground.
