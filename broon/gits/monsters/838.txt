WOLVES
	Once the most feared predator of the open plains the wolves 
now reside in forest or jungle terrain where they have been driven by 
more deadly competition. Although a fairly weak creature if met 
individually, wolves work together well and a small pack of wolves 
will often defeat larger and more powerful creatures.
