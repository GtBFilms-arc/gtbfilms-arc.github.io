SHADOW
		Shadows are the demonic servants of Ythcal. They are malicious spirits which 
feed upon the raw emotions of terror and hatred. Once a shadow has selected a victim it will appear 
each night and cruelly play with the victims emotions until the victim eventually dies a mad 
gibbering wreck. Although it has no material body the spirit can form sharp claws and teeth which 
it scratches and gouges to cause pain and to drain life from its victim.
