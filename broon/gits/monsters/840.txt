KREOURSE
	The kreourse is a deadly hunter with a taste for horse flesh. 
In appearance they look like a large powerful horse but with jaws like 
a mantrap and razor sharp teeth. They prefer not to fight and can 
usually avoid it easily. Their loud roar is very distinctive and 
horses are terrified by it. Their favoured tactic is to charge towards 
a group roaring loudly. Unless securely tied the group's horses will 
scatter in panic. The kreourse then stops its charge and picks off the 
scattered horses at its leisure. The group, now on foot, seldom manage 
to catch up with it but can usually recapture most of their horses if 
they stay in the area. Kreourse usually reside in open, barren or 
rough terrain.
