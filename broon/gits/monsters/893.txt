WHOMPER
The whomper makes an awesome opponent. Its strength and toughness make it very difficult to kill. 
However, if it takes too much damage it will run away to fight another day. This hairy, armour plated 
monster is highly territorial and will attack on sight all creatures it deems to be trespassing in its 
domain. The whomper has a massive low slung body, weighing anything up to a ton, covered in a 
mixture of shaggy fur and thick bony plates. Its heavy tail is as long again as its body. Fringing the 
whomper's mouth are numerous tentacle-like appendages, which vibrate during combat, sending out 
psionic waves. These have the effect of breaking down molecules and their effect on flesh can be 
horrific. No armour can block them.
