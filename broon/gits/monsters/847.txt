HILL GIANT
	Giants are probably the stupidest of the humanoid races and 
the Hill Giants are no exception. They are weak willed, slow witted 
and extremely childish. They enjoy nothing more than eating and if 
food is readily available they will eat until they can not move. The 
only accomplishment ever made by this race was learning how to make 
beer. Since their attitude towards drinking is the same as it is 
towards eating things have gone downhill ever since.
