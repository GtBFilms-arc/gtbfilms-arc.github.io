SEWER DEMON
The sewer demon is a relative of the troll. Unlike ordinary trolls 
they can not regenerate damage but they are just as strong. They can 
stay under water for long periods of time and find it very easy to 
surprise their victims. They usually live underground or in swamps 
but have been known to reside in town sewers, hence their name.
