GOBLIN
	Goblins are a primitive humanoid race found throughout the 
wilderness of Kharne. They have dark skin, and sharp claws and teeth. 
By human reckoning they are extremely ugly. Goblins are cruel, greedy 
and usually evil but seldom stupid. All but a few worship the evil gods
, mainly Fleyshur. Goblins are nocturnal creatures and are seldom seen
during daylight.
