HOBGOBLIN
	The largest of the Goblin races are known as Hobgoblins. Like 
their smaller brethren they are dark skinned, ugly and savage. They 
are less well equipped than most goblins and even more primitive but 
their size and strength make them dangerous in combat. They are not 
very intelligent and have no formal religious beliefs.
