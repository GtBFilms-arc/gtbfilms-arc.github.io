KOBOLD
	Kobolds are small goblin like creatures. They are primitive 
and brutal and not particularly intelligent. They live by raiding 
farms and small groups of travellers for food and equipment. They are 
nocturnal and are rarely seen during the day. They usually live in 
caves or underground lairs close to centres of population. Without the 
presence of farms nearby they would soon starve as they are poor 
hunters. Most kobold tribes worship Molwanh and they will treat other 
followers of Molwanh with respect.
