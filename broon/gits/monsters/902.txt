XOROA
	Otherwise known as the ant centaur, the xoroa has the rear six legs of an ant and the torso, 
arms and head of a human, standing about six feet tall in total. This creature is generally accepted to be 
a magical experiment gone wrong. Xoroa live in hidden villages, usually in mountains but also in 
forests where their legs easily transport them past trees and through undergrowth. In combat they fight 
in groups, the majority using shortswords and shields, although some may have long swords or short 
bows. Xoroas are very protective of their village and will fight to the death to defend them.
