UNICORN
	The noble savage of the great forests. The unicorn is built 
like a powerful but extremely graceful horse with a white coat and a 
lethal ivory horn growing from its forehead. Unicorns have a natural 
hatred for all evil creatures and will attack fearlessly any which 
move into its domain. It is said that those with pure heart and the 
blessing of the gods can ride a unicorn but there are no reliable 
records of this ever taking place. Those who have attempted to ride 
without the unicorn's consent are usually lucky if they survive.
