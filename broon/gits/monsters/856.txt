QUIKADU
The quikadu is a large flightless bird found on the open plains of 
Kharne. It can run at great speed which keeps it out of trouble most 
of the time. If combat is unavoidable the male is equipped with a 
chitinous horn on its head. This can inflict considerable damage 
especially if the quikadu has a good run up. Several attempts have 
been made to train quikadu as mounts but without success so far. They 
are certainly strong enough to carry a man but they are not easy to 
train and react violently to anyone climbing on board.
