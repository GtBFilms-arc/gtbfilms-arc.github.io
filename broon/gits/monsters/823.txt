GIANT SPIDER
As with many of the giant sized denizens of Kharne, the giant spider 
is not only very large but also poisonous. The largest specimens are 
about five foot long in the body with a leg span of up to fifteen 
feet. The poison they inject is not deadly but it places the victim 
in a deep coma. Characters in coma will eventually starve to death 
if no way to wake them is found. Giant spiders do not use webs. 
They are found underground or in mountainous terrain.
