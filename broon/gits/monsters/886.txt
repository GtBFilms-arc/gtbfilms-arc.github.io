BLOOD WEED
	Sometimes called Vampire Grass this plant supplements its diet of sunshine and soil with a 
large measure of blood. The grass grows about two feet long and is sensitive to heat and movement. 
If anyone passes through or next to the grass it will wrap around their legs and try to pull them 
down. The grass is razor sharp. Blood from wounded victims soaks into the ground and is sucked 
up by the roots. The blood turns the grass a dark red colour after feeding so well fed grass is easy to 
avoid.
