BASILISK
	Mistaking this deadly creature for a large lizard is often the 
last mistake of foolhardy adventurers. The Basilisk is about nine feet 
long with a scaly hide, six short legs, a tail, a large mouth full of 
very sharp pointy teeth and a look which can kill. Anyone unfortunate 
enough to meet the gaze of an angry basilisk will be turned instantly 
to stone. Fortunately the Basilisk is quite rare and only ever found 
underground.
