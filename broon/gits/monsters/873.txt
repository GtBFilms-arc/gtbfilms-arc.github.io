WIGHT
	The spirits of the dead are sometimes trapped in their bodies by curses or by evil magic. 
They continue to live a kind of half life as a Wight. They dwell in burial mounds or deep 
underground and sunlight causes them enormous pain. At night they feed upon the souls of any 
mortal foolish enough to stray near their lair. The touch of a wight drains the life essence from their 
foes, leaving them greatly weakened and sometimes dead. In appearance a wight looks similar to a 
zombie but they are stronger and faster and often highly intelligent.
