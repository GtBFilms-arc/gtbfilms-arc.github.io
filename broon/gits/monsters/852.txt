GOLEM
	Golems are an artificial life form constructed from dismembered
 bodies and animated by an evil spirit. They are believed to have been
 created by the sect of Ythcal many centuries ago but knowledge of the
 secrets involved has now been lost. Golems are of about human size 
but immensely strong and they must be literally hacked to pieces before
 they will stop fighting. They have no mind and only act to obey the 
instructions given to them by their creator.
