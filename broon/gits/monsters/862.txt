CAVE BEAR
	Similar to an ordinary bear in all respects but size and diet. 
The gigantic cave bear is about twice the size of an ordinary bear 
and is a carnivore. They are very strong and well equipped with claws 
and teeth. Their thick coats and skin protect them from harm and also 
manage to block most poisons. Cave bears are ferocious beasts and will 
seldom run away from combat even if seriously injured.
