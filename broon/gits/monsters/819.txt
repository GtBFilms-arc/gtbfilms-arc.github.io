CAVEMEN
The primitive race from which humanity descended still survives in 
areas away from the centres of population. They have a stone age 
technology and live by hunting and gathering. The race is rapidly 
dying out as they are unable to protect themselves from attacks by the 
goblin races with whom they must compete for food. They are ferocious 
fighters but few in number and poorly equipped.
