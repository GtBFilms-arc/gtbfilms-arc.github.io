LIZARD MEN
As humanity descended from the apes, so the lizard men descended from 
the reptiles of the swamps. They walk on two hind legs with a long tail
 to aid balance. The tail also helps them to swim at great speed. The 
average height is about six foot but specimens as tall as seven foot 
are not uncommon. They are quite primitive and many tribes are 
extremely warlike. The large bounty offered on lizard man heads by 
some towns may help to explain this.
