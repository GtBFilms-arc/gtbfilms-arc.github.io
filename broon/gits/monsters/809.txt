WYVERN
	When a large poisonous snake is crossed with a bat the size of 
a hut, the result is a mess but if you add two powerful clawed legs 
and a scorpion sting in the tail you now have a deadly fighting machine
known as the Wyvern. Wyverns are often mistaken for dragons but they 
are smaller, far less deadly, and much less intelligent. Unfortunately
they are a lot more common especially in mountainous terrain.
