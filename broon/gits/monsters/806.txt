GARGOYLE
	The Gargoyle has the appearance of a humanoid figure with large
wings. The gargoyle's flesh is stonelike making it difficult to harm 
and very heavy. Its great weight makes it slow and clumsy in flight. 
In combat a gargoyle emits an eerie screech and this combined with its 
demonic appearance will often cause panic and flight amongst its 
enemies. They usually live underground but a few live in old temples 
or graveyards.
