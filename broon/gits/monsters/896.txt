KATRIM
	Katrims are humanoids of cat-like appearance. Brown and yellow fur covers their bodies. They 
are slightly larger and stronger than humans, and possess great speed and dexterity. Katrims regard all 
other creatures as inferior and most of them as a source of food. These masters of sneak attacks fight 
with natural claws, teeth or long iron claws strapped to their hands. They have incredible stealth and 
can be in the middle of a party of adventurers, killing, before anyone has even seen them. Their natural 
habitat is jungle but larger tribes have been seen in the open.
