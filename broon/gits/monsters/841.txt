TIGER
	Tigers are the main predator in forest and jungle terrain. 
They are powerful, fast and cunning. Although they are territorial 
creatures they do not regard adventurers as a threat and will usually
ignore them. Tigers which have been wounded are sometimes much more 
dangerous as they are unable to catch their normal prey and become 
man-eaters instead. There is little to be gained from battling an 
angry tiger so characters with any sense will avoid them. Fanatical 
worshippers of Sundonak can take the easy route to warrior heaven by 
attacking them bare handed.
