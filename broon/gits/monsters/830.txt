GIANT BAT
	Most bats are too small to be a threat to adventurers. The 
giant variety is the exception. Not only can it cause great damage 
with its claws and teeth but it is also a carrier of many kinds of 
disease. Many characters have walked away from battle with nothing 
more than a few bat scratches, and then died several weeks later, 
frothing at the mouth and writhing in agony. Giant bats are nocturnal 
and often attack sleeping groups.
