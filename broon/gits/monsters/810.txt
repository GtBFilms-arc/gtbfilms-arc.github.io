DWARVES
	Dwarves are known throughout the world for their love of gold 
and their tough, no-nonsense approach to life. As a general rule, poor 
dwarves want to get rich, and rich dwarves want to get richer. Anything
else, even a good brawl, has to take second place. Dwarves are 
determined, stubborn and argumentative but prepared to work very hard 
for good money. They feel most at home in hilly or mountainous terrain 
but can be found all over the world. Most dwarves worship the gods of 
war and good, mainly Garthrana. Their weapon and armour smiths are 
amongst the best in the world.
