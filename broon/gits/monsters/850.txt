CYCLOPS
The cyclops is closely related to the giants but is easily recognisable
 by the single large eye in the centre of its forehead. The lack of 
depth perception due to just one eye makes the cyclops a clumsy 
creature but it makes up to some extent with raw power and meanness. 
They are not very intelligent and usually fight with a large wooden 
or stone club.
