HALF-BLOODS
	A generic term which includes half-orc, half-goblin, half-gnoll
, etc. Their human heritage (usually on the mothers side) permits them 
to enter towns and cities but they are seldom treated with respect and 
are excluded from all but low class inns and hostelries. As a result of
 ancestry and social deprivation they are generally mean, cowardly 
scum. Even those few who cultivate more virtuous habits are constantly 
sneered at and humiliated by those of purer blood.
