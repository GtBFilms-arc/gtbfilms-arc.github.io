ROC
		Rocs are huge birds, like an eagle but many times 
bigger. Large specimens will grow to almost dragon size. They can 
pick up a horse in their enormous talons and their razor sharp beaks 
can cut through armour like cloth. They reside in mountainous terrain 
and usually avoid towns. Travellers are advised to keep well away 
from their nests.
