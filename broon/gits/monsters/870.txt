ZOMBIE
		Zombies are formed when the spirits of the dead are 
trapped in their bodies by evil magic or a curse. Within a few days 
of being trapped in the rotting flesh the mind is totally insane and 
the zombie will obey its masters every wish. Zombies are slow moving 
and clumsy and their rotting muscles and tendons make them quite weak 
but they must be completely hacked to pieces before they will stop 
fighting.
