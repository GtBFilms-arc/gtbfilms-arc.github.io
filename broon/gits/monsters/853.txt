OGRE
	Ogres are large humanoid creatures with ugly features, swarthy 
skin and big muscles. Although fearsome to look upon they are generally
 good natured. Unfortunately they enjoy a 'friendly' punch up from 
time to time, and being a bit dim witted they tend to forget their own 
strength. The end result is often a bloody mess on one side and an 
embarrassed ogre on the other. Ogres can usually be found in hilly or 
mountainous terrain, or underground.
