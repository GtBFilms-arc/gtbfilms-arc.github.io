ANKLET
	Anklets are small doglike creatures with brightly coloured 
furs, usually blue, but occasionally red. They live on a diet of 
roots, insects, and small mammals. Their homes are underground burrows 
which they will defend ferociously. Although they are not strong 
enough to threaten a man in the open in the confined spaces of their 
burrows they are deadly opponents. Anklets are fascinated by bright 
shiny objects and destructive adventurers sometimes dig up the burrows 
to see what the anklets have collected.
