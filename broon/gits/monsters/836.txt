SCORPION WASP
	The deadliest insect found on Kharne combines the worst 
features of a scorpion and a wasp. It has a vicious temper, powerful 
wings and a long prehensile tail with a poisonous stinger at the tip. 
It will usually attack anything that moves. Fortunately they are rare
and found only underground.
