GNOLL
	Gnolls are a race of dog faced humanoids. Their hands are 
pawlike but can hold weapons effectively. They are a short-lived and 
morbid race and most tribes worship Ythcal, Lord of Death. Gnolls tend 
to be quite small and scrawny and are not known for their great 
courage. They will seldom initiate combat without good reason.
