GIANT ANT
	Giant Ants are about seven feet long. They have powerful 
mandibles capable of cutting through armour and dripping with poison. 
The poison seldom causes death but it is acidic and causes serious 
wounds and great pain. Giant ants have no real mind to speak of and 
will often fight to the death. They are usually found in jungle or 
marshy terrain.
