NIMROD
	Nimrods are the supernatural revenants of an ancient race of warriors. Their mortal forms died 
long ago during a quest to destroy all of Kharne's evil monsters. They are human in appearance but 
they average nine feet in height and have six arms, each of which has a more than reasonable skill in a 
different weapon. In life they were taught to believe that all other races were inferior to them, and their 
centuries of unlife have filled them with bitterness and rage. They will attack anything that enters the 
chamber where they died. If you are unlucky enough to discover a nimrod, you have two choices: kill it 
or run. However, you should beware the curse of the nimrod, which enables it to follow you anywhere 
in the dungeon. Leave the dungeon and you are safe, but stay there and it will attack until you or it are 
destroyed.
