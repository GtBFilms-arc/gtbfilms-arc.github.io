WRAITH
	Wraiths are immaterial beings formed from the spirits of the restless dead. They are bound 
to the mortal world by strong emotional ties of hatred or remorse which prevent them from passing 
onto the afterlife. Although they have no bodies they still need to feed and the only sustenance 
available is the life force of the living creatures around them. They drain this with their chilling 
touch. Wraiths appear only at night and look like a ghostly corpse with claws and eyes which look 
like black pits.
