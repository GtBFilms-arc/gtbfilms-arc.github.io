SLEECH
	The hideous sleech is a huge blood sucking slug. They are 
fortunately rare. Mature specimens measure about forty feet in length.
 They have thick rubbery skin and can soak up enormous amounts of 
damage before suffering serious injury. They move slowly but can 
easily keep up with a group struggling through swampy terrain. A 
sleech will never retreat from combat.
