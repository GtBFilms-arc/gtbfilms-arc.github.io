HYDRA
One of the few things deadlier than a large fire breathing lizard is a 
large fire breathing lizard with several heads. The dreaded Hydra has 
up to seven of them, each capable of breathing flame, or biting through
anything which doesn't burn well. The Hydra lives in subterranean 
locations and is especially comfortable in deep dungeons. The Hydra is 
a stubborn beast and seldom flees from combat even if fighting against 
overwhelming odds.
