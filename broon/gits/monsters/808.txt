DRAGON
One of the oldest races on Kharne and certainly the deadliest but 
fortunately now very rare. Dragons are solitary creatures and avoid 
even their own kind (one of the reasons for the current low population)
. To call a dragon a large winged lizard is an insult of the worst 
kind but it is roughly what they look like. They are highly intelligent
 but arrogant, cruel, selfish, and devious. Their weaponry is 
impressive. They have razor sharp claws and teeth, and a tail which 
could stun an elephant. They have an incredible aura of age and power 
which can panic their foes in combat. They can breathe searing flames 
over anyone foolish to stand in front of them and it is rumoured that 
they can even use magic. Their long lives have made them cautious and 
at the first sign of a battle going against them they will usually fly 
away to fight another day.
