MINOTAUR
	Part man and part bull, the ferocious minotaur is a deadly 
opponent encountered in the underworld. Most fight with their powerful 
arms and the bulls horns upon their heads but some also use weapons 
captured from previous victims. They are solitary creatures and will 
attack anyone or thing entering their territory.
