SEER
	A seer is a powerful spirit servant of Phyloqure. It is said that all knowledge is available to 
them and there is nothing which they do not know or can not find out. They often act as messengers 
from Phyloqure to his priests and the high priests of his sect can summon them to act as oracles. 
Although they know everything they will often not answer questions or will answer them indirectly. 
Phyloqure teaches that knowledge must be earned. It has no value if given as a gift.
