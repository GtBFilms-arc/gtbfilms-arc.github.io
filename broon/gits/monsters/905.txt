MONK
	A monk is a human follower of one of the eight gods of Kharne,
who is on some religious pilgrimage or quest. Monks are often found
travelling on roads, journeying from temple to temple. All the monks
in a group encountered by a party will be aligned to the same god. 
A monk's behaviour depends on his alignment. Monks of Garthrana, 
Sundonak or Fleyshur are usually hostile, while monks of Phyloqure 
are peaceful and might even be communicative. As a reward for their 
devotion, monks are given considerable protection by their patron 
god, making them dangerous in combat. It is rumoured that monks of 
Sundonak are among the best warriors in the land. Monks are often 
targets of assassination attempts by followers of opposing religions, 
since this is known to please the opposing god.
