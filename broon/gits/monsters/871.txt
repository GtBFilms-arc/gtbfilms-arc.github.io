GHOULS
		Sometimes known as the Slaves of Ythcal, ghouls are humanoid creatures which feed upon 
the bodies of the dead. Graveyards all over the world have to be protected to prevent ghouls from 
digging up the buried coffins and breaking them open to feast upon the rotting corpses within. The 
filth upon a ghouls teeth and claws acts a paralysing poison making them deadly foes in combat. 
They are of low intelligence but have an animal cunning.
