BANDIT
	Kharne's wilderness is populated by monsters, adventurers, and bandits. These groups of 
society's outcasts include humans, dwarves, elves and half-bloods. These brigands have found lives 
raiding small communities and ambushing travellers and adventurers. They steal and kill to survive, 
but are cowardly and will run if faced with a serious threat. Most bandits are poor, unskilled warriors, 
relying on their numbers in combat, and are no threat to most parties.
