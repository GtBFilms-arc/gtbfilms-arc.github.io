MOLWANH - GODDESS OF FlELDS</H3><H4></B>
    Molwanh derives the bulk of her strength from the power of the natural world and
as a result is a militant conservationist. Her dislike of those who disrupt the normal 
flow of life borders on hatred and the pollution and damage caused by the cities and towns of the
civilised world offend her.

Most priests who pray to her do so in an
attempt at appeasement but there are a few who
support her views and do what they can to
prevent the growth of cities and towns. These few
are rewarded with special miracles which enable
them to control some of the forces of nature.
They also have access to the powers of Ythcal
and Novala who share some of Molwanh's views.<p>

Molwanh expects regular prayer from her
followers and donations at her temples and
shrines are often made by the most faithful. Her
followers should protect the ways of nature at all
times. Killing animals for food is acceptable.
Killing annimals for their furs, or for a bounty on
their heads is definitely not.<p>

Molwanh will not be pleased by any
actions which further the cause of civilisation.
The building of roads and bridges or the construction of new towns angers her greatly but
the mass destruction of forest land for timber is probably the worst crime in her eyes.<p>

<H3>PLANT CONTROL (601)</H3><H4></B>
A useful spell to protect the party from the ravages of the many kinds of sentient
plant life which can be found. It can also be used to animate ordinary plant life to hinder
the efforts of your foes in combat. If used against a particular plant write the monster type
or monster group to be affected. To animate ordinary plant life write a target of 'O'.<p>

<H3>BLIGHT (602)</H3><H4></B>
    A miracle commonly used by Molwanh's priests as a punishment against farmers
or townsfolk who have displeased her. The spell will reduce the fertility of the sector in
which it is used, often leadlng to crop failure and food shortages for nearby towns. The
spell can also be used to attack sentient plants in combat.<br>
     The target for this spell is the monster type or monster class of the plant being
attacked. A target of zero is used to curse crops.<p>


<H3>INSANITY (603)</H3><H4></B>

     A potentially devestating weapon agoinst the growth of civilisation. This miracle is
only really effective in towns. When cast a proportion of the citizens will be driven insane
by malicious spirits. The mad citizens will then rampage through the town killing other
citizens and wrecking property until the town militia put them out of their misery.
No target is required for this spell.<p>
