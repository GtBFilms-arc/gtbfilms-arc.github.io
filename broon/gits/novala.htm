NOVALA - LADY OF FORTUNE</H3><H4></B>
Of all the gods, Novala's outlook on life is probably closest to that of ordinary mortals. Her main goal is the
seeking of pleasure and she constantly seeks new ways to amuse herself. Her power is believed to derive from the
emotions and passions of mortals, possibly one of the reasons she is said to be the patron goddess of love.

Despite her popularity and considerable power Novala prefers to avoid the use of excessive force. Subtlety and
deception are her favored weapons and this is reflected in the powers with which she rewards her loyal priests.
Priests of Novala are also adept with the powers by Molwanh and Phyloqure.
<p>
Regular prayer and donation are sure ways to Novala's favor but she also expects to be amused. Acts of trickery
and cunning are good ways to gain her attention and she keeps a special look out for the welfare of thieves.
<p>
She is displeased by acts of unnecessary violence for they lack the subtlety she enjoys and also bring her name
into disrepute. Followers of Novala should beware for sometimes she will deliberately drop them into trouble for
the amusement of watching them trying to escape.<p>

<H3>LUCK OF NOVALA (702)</H3><H4></B>
A special blessing which ensures good fortune for the party in all actions involving an element of chance (including combat,
information gathering, recruiting, etc.). The extent of the good fortune will vary with the priest's ability and spiritual closeness to
Novala. The miracle remains in effect until the end of the turn in which it was cast.
<br>

<p>


<H3>HIDING (703)</H3><H4></B>

A form of invisibility which makes detection of the 'cloaked' group very difficult. A powerful priest can protect his group not

next turn or till the 'cloaked' group is discovered. 
<br>
The miracle target is 99.
