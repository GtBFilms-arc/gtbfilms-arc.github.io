THE PANTHEON OF KHARNE</H3><H4></B>
All but a small minority of the population of Kharne spread their worship amongst all of the gods. Those who
restrict their worship to a single god, or goddess, are generally regarded as fanatics. Even most adventurer groups
will worship several gods rather than just one.

The temples found in the towns and cities of Kharne are open to the general public at all times but most have inner
sanctums, accessible only to the truly devout followers of the temple's god. Attempts by groups of neutral or
opposing alignment to enter these areas will be strongly opposed. In the event of violence, or death resulting from
a break in, town militia and courts will invariably take sides with the temple.<p>

Groups of extreme alignment may find themselves forbidden to enter even the public areas of a temple but this is
not common. In addition to the town temples there are rumored to be special shrines dedicated to each of the gods.
The great relics of the different religions will often be located in these shrines. The locations of the shrines are
closely guarded secrets and death is said to be the reward for any who betray the secret of a shrines location. <p>

<H3>RITUAL (901)</H3><H4></B>
A heading which covers a wide variety of simple ceremonies of a religious nature. The commonest use is to sanctify a building.
If the ritual is performed by the priest whose alignment is radically different to the alignment of the location of the ritual is
considered to be a ritual of desecration.<br>
The target should be the building number to be affected. 
<p>

<H3>MANNA (902)</H3><H4></B>
Sustenance is no problem for a priest with this ability. When used, it will provide sufficient food to feed the priests group with
some to spare. The food is highly nourishing and will help restore fitness and health to injured or tired characters. 
<br>
A target of 99 is required for this miracle.
<p>


<H3>CALL SPIRIT (903)</H3><H4></B>

With this miracle, a priest summons a spiritual servant to aid him for the remainder of the turn. The nature of the spirit will
depend upon the alignment of the priest. A spirit summoned by a follower of Fleyshur would be powerful in combat, whereas a
follower of Phyloqure would be aided in all kinds of information gathering.
<br>
No target is required for this miracle.
