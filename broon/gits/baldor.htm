BALDOR - LORD OF HEALING</H3><H4></B>
Baldor is one of the more powerful gods and is of good alignment. He looks with favor upon those who protect the
weak from harm, and upon those who oppose the evil followers of Fleyshur and Ythcal.

The miracles granted by Baldor to his priests are all forms of healing or protection. Baldor is on favorable terms
with Garthrana and Phyloqure and his priests can often use the powers sponsored by these gods. 
<p>
As with all the gods, there are certain actions which will gain favor and others which will cause Baldor's
displeasure. 
<p>
All followers of Baldor should pray to him regularly using the 'P 1' order. They should also make donations at
Baldor temples using the 'G' order with the temple number as the target of the action. They should issue an 'A 0 1'
order to set a general attitude of friendly as Baldor does not approve of needless violence. Completed quests which
help the poor or weak will always gain Baldor's favor. 
<p>
An attitude of '3', hostile, should never be used, except possibly against followers of Fleyshur or Ythcal. The 'E'
and 'W' orders should be treated with similar caution. Quests for personal gain and quests sponsored by patrons of
dubious alignment should not be undertaken.<p>

<H3>HEALING (101)</H3><H4></B>
Generally recognized as one of the most useful miracles available to a priest. Healing will restore health to any injured character.
As with all miracles, the effectiveness will be determined by the priests skill and his spiritual closeness to the miracles sponsor
(in this case Baldor).
<br>
The target is the character to be healed. Write a target of 99 to heal all your group.
<p>

<H3>CURE POISON (102)</H3><H4></B>
A potent miracle against poisons of all kinds. When used it will slow or neutralize the poison depending upon the relative
strengths of the priest using the miracle and the poison he is attempting to cure. It will not restore damage suffered as a result of
the poison.
<br>
The target is the character to be cured. Write '99' for your own group.


<p>


<H3>BALDOR'S TOUCH (103)</H3><H4></B>
Baldor's Touch is effective against all forms of disease. Depending upon the power of the priest, it will totally cure the disease
or at least alleviate the symptoms for a short while. If the disease is totally cured, all toughness lost as a result of the illness will
be fully restored at the same time. 
<br>
The target should be the affected character.
