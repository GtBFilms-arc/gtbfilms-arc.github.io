<H2><A NAME="AcidBlast"><FONT COLOR=#800000>ACID BLAST<BR>
</FONT></A></H2>

<P>
As this spell is cast a deluge of corrosive fluid smites the chosen
target causing unpleasant burns. Although the spell causes less
damage to creatures than some of the other magical attacks, it
also causes extensive damage to weapons, armour and other equipment.
<BR>

<P>
The target for this spell is the monster type, monster group,
or player group to be affected.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<H2><A NAME="Awaken"><FONT COLOR=#800000>AWAKEN<BR>
</FONT></A></H2>

<P>
An effective spell against most kinds of magical or drug induced
slumber. If cast successfully any characters affected will immediately
wake up. <BR>

<P>
Spell target is the monster type, monster group, character, or
player group to be affected.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<H2><A NAME="BallOfFire"><FONT COLOR=#800000>BALL OF FIRE<BR>
</FONT></A></H2>

<P>
With this spell a mage can summon a searing ball of flames to
scorch his enemies. Although summoned by magic the flames are
ordinary in other respects and will therefore not affect creatures
immune to ordinary fire. The flames will cause damage to any wooden
or flammable material carried by the target. <BR>

<P>
Target for this spell is the monster type, monster group, or player
group to be affected.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<H2><A NAME="BattleLust"><FONT COLOR=#800000>BATTLE LUST<BR>
</FONT></A></H2>

<P>
A powerful but risky spell. When cast the mage's own group will
fight with berserk disregard for danger, injury or pain. Their
combat strength will be higher than usual and their obvious insanity
may well cause timid enemy groups to flee in terror. The spell
causes your group to ignore your own retreat factors and there
is a good chance of serious losses if the battle goes against
you. <BR>

<P>
The target for this spell is '99'<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<H2><A NAME="BlackVoid"><FONT COLOR=#800000>BLACK VOID<BR>
</FONT></A></H2>

<P>
A deadly offensive spell against creatures of all kinds. When
the spell is cast a magical gate is opened into another plane.
Anyone, or thing, close to the gate is sucked towards it and will
be lost for ever in the void. The pull is fortunately not too
powerful and most creatures will be strong enough to resist it
unless they are unlucky or very close. <BR>

<P>
The target for this spell is the monster type, monster group or
player group to be affected.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H2><A NAME="ChokingGas"><FONT COLOR=#800000>CHOKING GAS<BR>
</FONT></A></H2>

<P>
With this spell a mage summons a dense cloud of gas to plague
his enemies. Weak opponents will find it almost impossible to
breath and their combat strength will be reduced. More powerful
opponents will be affected less and undead creatures not at all.
<BR>

<P>
The target for this spell is the monster type, monster group,
or player group to be affected.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<H2><A NAME="Confusion"><FONT COLOR=#800000>CONFUSION I, II<BR>
</FONT></A></H2>

<P>
Although they cause no physical damage these are very effective
combat spells against all creature types. The target is confused
and is unable to think straight which makes fighting very difficult.
CONFUSION I affects just one creature whereas CONFUSION II will
affect several. <BR>

<P>
Spell target is the monster type, monster group, or player group
to be affected.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<H2><A NAME="CureDisease"><FONT COLOR=#800000>CURE DISEASE<BR>
</FONT></A></H2>

<P>
A useful spell for the curing of most illnesses but not all. The
most potent diseases will be eased but not wholly cured. Only
a devout priest of Baldor can cure these. The spell will not restore
toughness lost as a result of the illness. <BR>

<P>
Spell target is the character number of the ill character.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<H2><A NAME="DeflectMagic"><FONT COLOR=#800000>DEFLECT MAGIC I,
II, III<BR>
</FONT></A></H2>

<P>
The three DEFLECT MAGIC spells provide useful protection against
attacks by enemy mages. They reduce the effectiveness of any magical
spells cast against the users group. DEFLECT MAGIC I is the weakest
of these spells and DEFLECT MAGIC III the most powerful. There
is a small chance that the magic deflected will actually be reflected
towards the mage who cast it. <BR>

<P>
The spell target is '99'.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<H2><A NAME="DestroyUndead"><FONT COLOR=#800000>DESTROY UNDEAD
I, II<BR>
</FONT></A></H2>

<P>
The DESTROY UNDEAD spells are the most cost effective method for
mages wishing to remove undead creatures from a combat. Only the
weakest undead creatures will be destroyed outright but others
will suffer considerable damage. The spell affect all undead creatures
in the targeted group.<BR>

<P>
The target for the spell is the type or group number of the monster
to be affected<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<H2><A NAME="DetectTreasure"><FONT COLOR=#800000>DETECT TREASURE
I,II,III<BR>
</FONT></A></H2>

<P>
Information spells which provide the location of any nearby buried
treasure. The spells only work in the wilderness. DETECT TREASURE
I has a range of just a few sectors. The higher level the spells
have progressively greater ranges. <BR>

<P>
No target is required for these spells.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<H2><A NAME="Disintegrate"><FONT COLOR=#800000>DISINTEGRATE<BR>
</FONT></A></H2>

<P>
A powerful offensive spell. The main effect is the destruction
of non-living material, i.e. swords, armour and other equipment.
As such this spell isn't very effective against creatures relying
on claws, teeth or other natural weaponry.<BR>

<P>
Target for the spell is the monster type, monster group or player
group to be affected<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<H2><A NAME="Dispel"><FONT COLOR=#800000>DISPEL I, II<BR>
</FONT></A></H2>

<P>
Useful spells for dispelling creatures or items. The target will
disappear from the mage's location and reappear some distance
away. In the wilderness this will usually be several miles off.
In a dungeon the target will reappear somewhere else on the same
level. The spell does not work in towns. <BR>

<P>
DISPEL I works on a single creature or item, whereas DISPEL II
will affect any number of creatures of the specified type or group.
<BR>

<P>
The target for these spells is the monster type, monster group,
player group, item, or item type to be affected. (If DISPEL I
is used against a monster group then the target will be chosen
at random from within this group)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<H2><A NAME="DrainLife"><FONT COLOR=#800000>DRAIN LIFE<BR>
</FONT></A></H2>

<P>
A spell to strike fear into the bravest of foes. When cast the
spell sucks the vitality (toughness) from the target creature.
 Weaker creatures will be killed outright but even the strongest
of foes will be greatly weakened. Undead creatures are obviously
unaffected by this spell.  <BR>

<P>
Spell target is monster type, monster group or player group to
be affected.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<H2><A NAME="EnchantWeapons"><FONT COLOR=#800000>ENCHANT WEAPONS I, II, III<BR>
</FONT></H2>

<P>
The ENCHANT WEAPONS spells are eagerly sought after by all warlike
groups. Using these spells a mage can temporarily enhance the
performance of any weapon type. ENCHANT WEAPONS I provides just
a minor improvement. ENCHANT WEAPONS II is more potent but still
affects just one character. ENCHANT WEAPONS III also provides
a strong enchantment and affects the weapons of your whole group.
<BR>

<P>
The target for spells I and II is the character carrying the weapon
to be affected. For spell III the target is '99'.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<H2><A NAME="EngulfingGlobe"><FONT COLOR=#800000>ENGULFING GLOBE
<BR>
</FONT></A></H2>

<P>
A black sphere of nothingness appears at the mages command. It
then moves randomly, sucking up anything that comes in the way.
Once sucked into the globe nothing is ever seen again. The globe
is unpredictable and often floats away from the target after sucking
up just a few enemies. <BR>

<P>
Target for the spell is the monster type, monster group, or player
group to be affected.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<H2><A NAME="ExitDungeon"><FONT COLOR=#800000>EXIT DUNGEON<BR>
</FONT></A></H2>

<P>
Escape is often high on the list of a group's priorities. With
this spell a group can teleport from any dungeon location to the
wilderness just outside the dungeon entrance. <BR>

<P>
No target is required.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<H2><A NAME="Fear"><FONT COLOR=#800000>FEAR I,II<BR>
</FONT></A></H2>

<P>
The fear spells cause no physical damage but instead fill the
target with terror. FEAR I only affects weak willed opponents
causing them to flee. FEAR II affects most opponents, and the
weak willed opponents may even be struck dead on the spot out
of pure terror! <BR>

<P>
The target for these spells is the monster type, monster group,
or player group to be affected.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<H2><A NAME="FleshRot"><FONT COLOR=#800000>FLESH ROT<BR>
</FONT></A></H2>

<P>
A spell which most mages save for use against their worst enemies.
The spell causes a dreadful rotting disease to afflict one character,
or thing, in the target group. Wounds suffered by an afflicted
character will fester and rot making healing, even by magical
means, impossible until the disease is cured. <BR>

<P>
The target for this spell is the monster type, monster group or
player group to be affected.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<H2><A NAME="Healing"><FONT COLOR=#800000>HEALING I,II,III,IV
<BR>
</FONT></A></H2>

<P>
The healing spells are very useful for restoring the health of
injured party members. HEALING I and II affect just a single character,
but III and IV affect all members of the target group. HEALING
II and IV heal more damage than I and III. <BR>

<P>
The target for I and II is the character to be affected. For III
and IV write '99' for your own group.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<H2><A NAME="IdentifyItem"><FONT COLOR=#800000>IDENTIFY ITEM<BR>
</FONT></A></H2>

<P>
The ideal spell for finding out what an item is, or what it does.
It will reveal all magical properties of an item (and its history,
purpose and true name if appropriate). <BR>

<P>
Spell target is the item to be identified.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<H2><A NAME="Invisibility"><FONT COLOR=#800000>INVISIBILITY<BR>
</FONT></A></H2>

<P>
One of the most potent defensive spells. Although it only lasts
for a short while the mage's group will be totally invisible for
the spell's duration. Most enemy creatures or groups will not
even realize they exist while the spell is working. <BR>

<P>
The target is &quot;99&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<H2><A NAME="Jaunt"><FONT COLOR=#800000>JAUNT I,II<BR>
</FONT></A></H2>

<P>
The Jaunt spells are a specialized form of teleportation devised
for use in dungeons. (The presence of so much solid rock makes
ordinary teleportation suicidal!) Jaunt I enables a mage to move
his group up or down a single dungeon level. Jaunt II enables
a mage to move his group to any level within the current dungeon.
<BR>

<P>
Spell target is the level you wish to move to.  To Jaunt out of
a dungeon write target '0'.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

player group to be affected.<BR>

</FONT></A></H2>

<P>
As this spell is cast a foul pestilence gusts towards the mage's

<BR>

<H2><A NAME="RevealTraps"><FONT COLOR=#800000>REVEAL TRAPS<BR>
</FONT></A></H2>

<P>
An essential spell for any group hurrying through a dungeon. Cast
this spell at the start of your turn and you will be able to detect
and avoid most traps along your route. (The location of the traps

<P>
No target is required.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<H2><A NAME="Shield"><FONT COLOR=#800000>SHIELD I, II, III<BR>
</FONT></A></H2>

<P>
These spells are guaranteed to make a mage popular with the fighters
in his party. When the spell is cast the recipient's armour is
magically enhanced, thus reducing the damage taken in combat.
SHIELD I has a fairly minor effect, with SHIELD II and SHIELD
III being much stronger. These spells only affect characters with
armour. <BR>

<P>
Spell target is the character to be affected.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<H2><A NAME="Sleep"><FONT COLOR=#800000>SLEEP I,II<BR>
</FONT></A></H2>

<P>
Useful spells against the weaker monster types and against other
parties. SLEEP I will only affect the weakest monster types, sending
them into a deep slumber. SLEEP II works in the same way but will
affect more powerful creatures. <BR>

Spell target should be the monster type, monster group, or player
group to be affected.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<H2><A NAME="SlowPoison"><FONT COLOR=#800000>SLOW POISON<BR>
</FONT></A></H2>

poison damage for the duration of the turn. The poison remains

is cast again. <BR>

<P>
Target for this spell is character number of the poisoned character.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<H2><A NAME="StopPoison"><FONT COLOR=#800000>STOP POISON<BR>
</FONT></A></H2>

character.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<H2><A NAME="TargetIllusion"><FONT COLOR=#800000>TARGET ILLUSION

The spell target is '99'<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<H2><A NAME="Teleport"><FONT COLOR=#800000>TELEPORT I,II,III<BR>
</FONT></A></H2>

<P>
The teleport spells have two main uses. Getting to somewhere fast
and getting out of trouble. The distance covered is a little unpredictable
but direction is at the mages control. TELEPORT I will move a
group between 1 and 5 sectors, TELEPORT II about 6 to 10, and
TELEPORT III about 11 to 15. (Mapping information gained prior
to teleportation will be lost. You will only receive a map of
movement made after the teleport.) <BR>

<P>
This target for this spell is the direction to be traveled.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<H2><A NAME="TotalDeath"><FONT COLOR=#800000>TOTAL DEATH<BR>
</FONT></A></H2>

<P>
A spell guaranteed to strike fear in any living creature. When
cast in combat one member of the target group, chosen at random,
will be killed instantly. Only powerful magical protection can
prevent this. This spell dose not affect non-living creatures
such as golems or undead. <BR>

<P>
Spell target is the monster type, monster group, or player group
to be affected. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<H2><A NAME="TurnUndead"><FONT COLOR=#800000>TURN UNDEAD I,II
<BR>
</FONT></A></H2>

<P>
These necromantic spells allow a mage to protect his party from
attacks by undead creatures. When the spell is cast affected creatures
will be unable to approach and may even be forced to flee. TURN
UNDEAD I only affects the weakest undead types. TURN UNDEAD II
is more potent but only a priest using the KILL UNDEAD power can
affect the strongest undead creatures. <BR>

<P>
The target for these spells must be the type number or group number
of the monsters you wish to affect.<BR>
