1 cleaned sheeps stomach<br>
2lb dry oatmeal<br>
1lb chopped mutton suet<br>
1lb lambs or deers liver - boiled &amp; minced<br>
1pt (2 cups) stock<br>
Heart &amp; lungs of sheep (boiled &amp; minced)<br>
1lb chopped onion<br>
1/2 teaspoon each of cayenne pepper, jamaican pepper (all spice)<br>
pepper &amp; salt.<br>
</center></p><h3>Cooking the haggis:</h3><p><center>Toast oatmeal until crisp then mix all ingredients (except sheeps stomach) together and add the stock. Fill bag to just over half full, press out air and sew up securely. Have ready large pot of boiling water, prick haggis all over with large needle so it does not burst. Bil slowly for 4 - 5 hours.</center></p><p><center>Note also - I have been advised that when boiling the lungs, it is wise to let the trachea (windpipe) hang over the side of the pot. If you don't do this and the trachea folds over on itself in the pot, the air trapped inside the lungs will expand and cause the lungs to burst, spraying your kitchen with boiling water and improperly cooked offal.Serves approx. 12.</center></p><p><center>Note - Oatmeal is NOT the same as oatmeal in the USA - I believe the US term is steel-cut oats.</center></p><hr  size=1><br><center><a href="food.htm">Back to Scottish Food</a></center><hr  size=1><br><center><a href="main.html">Back to FAQ Home Page</a></center><hr  size=1></body></html>
