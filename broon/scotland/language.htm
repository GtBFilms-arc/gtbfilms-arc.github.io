<p><center>Although English and Gaelic are the main languages of Scotland, several others have survived through to the modern day, thse include Punjabe, Hindu and Scots. The most famous of these is probably Scots, few will not have heard the famous word of Rabbie Burns 'It's a braw, bricht moonlicht nicht the nicht'. The Scots language have been further popularised by the zany exploits of the 'Broon' family each week in the Sunday Post.</center></p>

<p><center>The Scots langauage has many idiosyncracies, for example, if you were to BURN yourself, you might want to put water on the blister. You could get the water from a BURN, as a burn is a small Scottish stream!</center></p>

<p><center>If someone were to ask you if you knew something, you could answer in the negative by saying &quot;I dinna ken&quot;. If someone called Kenneth were to ask you if you knew Ken Clarke, you would have to reply &quot;I dinna ken, Ken, Ken&quot;!</center></p>

<p><center>If you see someone attractive, you might want them to kiss you, but in Glasgow this is the last thing you'd want, as a GLASGOW KISS involves the rapid movement of ones head into the face of another individual, often resulting in a broken nose.</center></p>

<p><center>Similarly, if a Glaswegian were to offer you &quot;one on the kisser&quot;, politely decline, as rather than offering to kiss you, he is offering to punch you in the face.</center></p>

<p><center>Gaelic speaking Scots (i.e. the vast majority of them) are a friendly people, but they can be quite formal on firt making the aquaintance of visitors. If you are lucky enough to meet any Scottish people in a semi-formal context (for example at a dinner party, or whilst taking a leak down a back alley after 15 pints of lager on a Friday night), you will be certain to make a good impression if you address them as 'cheuchters'. Cheuchter is a Gaelic word which has the same overtones as the Chinese 'taikoo' - respected and well-beloved - something like that. You should try it, it never fails.</center></p>

<p><center>Remember, Gaelic is Scotlands first language and is spoken everywhere, particularly in the large city centre bars where the barmen particularly appreciate being given the order in Gaelic rather than the less familiar English when they are busy. So, take time out to learn a few phrases of Gaelic before visiting Scotland.</center></p>
