Core GonadoVision site totally revamped! Incorporated Frames to allow music to play unbroken through whole site. 
Reduced graphic size, new animations, new standard page layout.<p>
NOTE: Clicking on the spinning GonadoVision logo will now always return you to the homepage! (Try it)<p>
The GonadoVision site is now only viewable on FRAMES compatible browsers. This was felt to be a sensible progression, as 
this feature became standard in HTML 3.0, and HTML 4.0 is now imminent, and logs of the previous version of this site indicate 
that almost everyone now uses a Frames compatible browser.
