As so few people have actually seen a haggis, it is not certain whether these creatures, which have become known as 'Jackalopes', are indeed the real thing, or simply another ploy to increase the revenue of the Tourist industry. For this reason, I have included comments on the 'Jackalope' in the Myths section, so you can make up your own mind about their authenticity.</center></p><h2>Readers Comments:</h2><center><h6>Colin Downie wrote:</h6></center><p><center>The jack-haggis - so named because it has the ability to adjust (jack) the length of each of its legs when browsing on the turnips (neeps) which grow wild on Scottish hillsides. Unlike the ordinary haggis this curious anatomical feature enables them to elude their pursuers, sober or not.</center></p><hr  size=1><center><h6>Bill Halliday (<a href="mailto:bill.halliday@mkbbs.co.uk">bill.halliday@mkbbs.co.uk</a>) wrote:</h6></center><p><center>There was a creature (stuffed this one was) in a country pursuits shop window in a village called Rothes, on Speyside in Moray, Scotland. This was about ten years ago. It was the size and looked very similar to, a large brown hare. However, it had antlers. They were similar to the short 'spikes' to be found on a Mountjack deer or a yearling Roe deer buck. Many spoilsports were heard to argue that it was merely the product of the overactive imagination of some taxidermist. Try as I might, I was never able to detect any sign of the antlers having been added.</center></p><hr  size=1><center><h6>Norman Paterson (<a href="mailto:nrp@st-andrews.ac.uk">nrp@st-andrews.ac.uk</a>) wrote:</h6></center><p><center>These things are quite widespread. I saw one in a museum near Marienplatz in Munich, a few years ago. There was a stuffed bear near it, about 2m high, raised up as if to attack. I suspect that they had both been shot just as the jackalope was about to kill the bear.</center></p><hr  size=1><!-- The following HTML tag is the internal link tag.
